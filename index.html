        Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about widgets, structures, and behaviors, in order to allow assistive technologies to convey appropriate information to persons with
        disabilities. This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and
        interoperability of web content and applications. These semantics are designed to allow an author to properly convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive
        technologies in document-level markup. This version adds features new since WAI-ARIA 1.1 [[wai-aria-1.1]] to improve interoperability with assistive technologies to form a more consistent
        accessibility model for [[HTML]] and [[SVG2]]. This specification complements both [[HTML]] and [[SVG2]].

      </p>
      <p>
        Roles defined by this specification are designed to support the roles used by platform <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a
        >. Declaration of these roles on elements within dynamic web content is intended to support interoperability between the web content and assistive technologies that utilize
        <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        The schema to support this standard has been designed to be extensible so that custom roles can be created by extending base roles. This allows [=user agents=] to support at least the base
        role, and user agents that support the custom role can provide enhanced access. Note that much of this could be formalized in [[XMLSCHEMA11-2]]. However, being able to define similarities
        between roles, such as <a href="#baseConcept">baseConcepts</a> and more descriptive definitions, would not be available in <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language Schema Datatypes">XSD</abbr>.

        <h2>Rich Internet Application Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
          The domain of web accessibility defines how to make web content usable by persons with disabilities. Persons with certain types of disabilities use <a>assistive technologies</a> (<abbr
            title="Assistive Technologies"
            >AT</abbr
          >) to interact with content. Assistive technologies can transform the presentation of content into a format more suitable to the user, and can allow the user to interact in different ways.
          For example, the user might need to, or choose to, interact with a slider widget via arrow keys, instead of dragging and dropping with a mouse. In order to accomplish this effectively, the
          software needs to understand the <a>semantics</a> of the content. Semantics is the science of meaning; in this case, used to assign roles, states, and properties that apply to user interface
          and content elements as a human would understand. For instance, if a paragraph is semantically identified as such, assistive technologies can interact with it as a unit separable from the
          rest of the content, knowing the exact boundaries of that paragraph. An adjustable range slider or collapsible list (a.k.a. a tree <a>widget</a>) are more complex examples, in which various
          parts of the widget have semantics that need to be properly identified for assistive technologies to support effective interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          New technologies often overlook semantics required for accessibility, and new authoring practices often misuse the intended semantics of those technologies. [=Elements=] that have one
          defined meaning in the language are used with a different meaning intended to be understood by the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, web application developers create collapsible tree widgets in HTML using CSS and JavaScript even though HTML has no semantic <code>tree</code> element. To a non-disabled user,
          it might look and act like a collapsible tree widget, but without appropriate semantics, the tree widget might not be <a>perceivable</a> to, or <a>operable</a> by, a person with a disability
          because assistive technologies might not recognize the role. Similarly, web application developers create interactive button widgets in SVG using JavaScript even though SVG has no semantic
          <code>button</code> element. To a non-disabled user, it might look and act like a button widget, but without appropriate semantics, the button widget might not be <a>perceivable</a> to, or
          <a>operable</a> by, a person with a disability because assistive technologies might not recognize the role.
        </p>
        <p>
          The incorporation of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a way for an author to provide proper semantics for custom widgets to make these widgets
          accessible, usable, and interoperable with assistive technologies. This specification identifies the types of widgets and structures that are commonly recognized by accessibility products,
          by providing an <a>ontology</a> of corresponding <a>roles</a> that can be attached to content. This allows elements with a given role to be understood as a particular widget or structural
          type regardless of any semantics inherited from the implementing host language. Roles are a common property of platform
          <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a> which assistive technologies use to provide the user with effective presentation and interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Roles Model includes interaction <a>widgets</a> and elements denoting document structure. The Roles Model describes inheritance and details the [=attributes=] each role supports.
          Information about mapping of roles to accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr> is provided by the
          <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite> [[CORE-AAM-1.2]].
        </p>
        <p>
          Roles are element types and will not change with time or user actions. Role information is used by assistive technologies, through interaction with the user agent, to provide normal
          processing of the specified element type.
        </p>
        <p>
          States and properties are used to declare important attributes of an element that affect and describe interaction. They enable the <a>user agent</a> and operating system to properly handle
          the element even when the attributes are dynamically changed by client-side scripts. For example, alternative input and output technology, such as screen readers and speech dictation
          software, need to be able to recognize and effectively manipulate and communicate various interaction states (e.g., disabled, checked) to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is possible for assistive technologies to access these properties directly through the <cite><a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">Document Object Model</a></cite> [[DOM]], the
          preferred mechanism is for the user agent to map the states and properties to the accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr> of the operating system. See the
          <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite> [[CORE-AAM-1.2]] and the
          <cite><a href="" class="accname">Accessible Name and Description Computation</a></cite> [[ACCNAME-1.2]] for details.

          our accessible platforms for GUIs (role, state, selection, <a>event</a> notification, <a>relationship</a> information, and descriptions). The DOM, usually HTML, acts as the data model and
          view in a typical model-view-controller relationship, and JavaScript acts as the controller by manipulating the style and content of the displayed data. The user agent conveys relevant
          information to the operating system's accessibility API, which can be used by any assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can also be used to assist persons with cognitive learning disabilities. The additional semantics allow authors to
          restructure and substitute alternative content as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a>Assistive technologies</a> need the ability to support alternative inputs by getting and setting the current value of <a>widget</a> states and properties. Assistive technologies also need
          to determine what <a>objects</a> are selected and manage widgets that allow multiple selections, such as list boxes and grids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speech-based command and control systems can benefit from <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics like the <code>role</code> attribute to assist in
          conveying audio information to the user. For example, upon encountering an element with a role of <rref>menu</rref> with child elements of role <rref>menuitem</rref> each containing text
          content representing a different flavor, a speech system might state to the user, "Select one of three choices: chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla."
        </p>
        <p>
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to be used as a supplement for native language semantics, not a replacement. When the host language provides a
          feature that provides equivalent accessibility to the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature, use the host language feature.
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> should only be used in cases where the host language lacks the needed <a>role</a>, <a>state</a>, and [=ARIA/property=]
          indicators. Use a host language feature that is as similar as possible to the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature, then refine the meaning by adding
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. For instance, a multi-selectable grid could be implemented as a table, and then
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> used to clarify that it is an interactive grid, not just a static data table. This allows for the best possible fallback
          for user agents that do not support <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and preserves the integrity of the host language semantics.

        <h2>User Agent Support</h2>
        <p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> relies on user agent support for its features in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mainstream [=user agents=] use <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> to alter how host language features are exposed to <a>accessibility APIs</a> in order to
            improve accessibility. The mechanism for this is defined in the <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite
            >.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a>Assistive technologies</a> use the enhanced information available in an accessibility API, or uses the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup
            directly via the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>, to convey semantic and interaction information to the user.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Aside from using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup to improve what is exposed to accessibility APIs, user agents behave as they would natively.
          Assistive technologies react to the extra information in the accessibility API as they already do for the same information on non-web content. User agents that are not assistive
          technologies, however, need do nothing beyond providing appropriate updates to the accessibility API.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> specification neither requires nor forbids user agents from enhancing native presentation and interaction behaviors on
          the basis of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup. Mainstream user agents might expose
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> navigational landmarks (for example, as a dialog box or through a keyboard command) with the intention to facilitate
          navigation for all users. User agents are encouraged to maximize their usefulness to users, including users without disabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to provide missing semantics so that the intent of the author can be conveyed to assistive technologies.
          Generally, authors using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> will provide the appropriate presentation and interaction features. Over time, host languages can
          add <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> equivalents, such as new form controls, that are implemented as standard accessible user interface controls by the
          user agent. This allows authors to use them instead of custom <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> enabled user interface components. In this case the user
          agent would support the native host language feature. Developers of host languages that implement <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> are advised to continue
          supporting <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics when they do not adversely conflict with implicit host language semantics, as
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics more clearly reflect the intent of the author if the host language features are inadequate to meet the author's
          needs.

        <h2>Co-Evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h2>
        <p>
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like [[HTML]] and [[SVG2]], or to be used as an accessibility
          enhancement technology in other markup-based languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. It clarifies semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of
          objects, via style and script, that are not yet directly supported by the language of the page, because the invention of new types of objects is faster than standardized support for them
          appears in web languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not appropriate to create objects with style and script when the host language provides a semantic element for that type of object. While
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can improve the accessibility of these objects, accessibility is best provided by allowing the user agent to handle the
          object natively. For example, it's better to use an <code>h1</code> element in HTML than to use the <rref>heading</rref> role on a <code>div</code> element.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is expected that, over time, host languages will evolve to provide semantics for objects that currently can only be declared with
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. This is natural and desirable, as one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to
          help stimulate the emergence of more semantic and accessible markup. When native semantics for a given feature become available, it is appropriate for authors to use the native feature and
          stop using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for that feature. Legacy content can continue to use
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, however, so the need for user agents to support
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> remains.
        </p>
        <p>
          While specific features of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> might lose importance over time, the general possibility of
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> to add semantics to web pages is expected to be a persistent need. Host languages might not implement all the semantics
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> provides, and various host languages can implement different subsets of the features. New types of objects are continually
          being developed, and one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to provide a way to make such objects accessible, because authoring practices often
          advance faster than host language standards. In this way, <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages both evolve together but at different rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example, SVG expresses the semantics behind production of graphical objects, not of user
          interface components that those objects can represent. Host languages might, by design, not provide native semantics that map to
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features. In these cases, <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> could be adopted as a
          long-term approach to add semantic information to user interface components.

          <p>
            Many of the requirements in the definitions of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a>roles</a>, <a>states</a>, and [=ARIA/properties=] can be checked
            automatically during the development process, similar to other quality control processes used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating custom widgets, authoring tools can
            compare widget roles, states, and properties to those supported in <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> as well as those supported in related and
            cross-referenced roles, states, and properties. Authoring tools can notify authors of errors in widget design patterns, and can also prompt developers for information that cannot be
            determined from context alone. For example, a scripting library can determine the labels for the tree items in a tree view, but would need to prompt the author to label the entire tree. To
            help authors visualize a logical accessibility structure, an authoring environment might provide an outline view of a web resource based on the
            <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup.
          </p>
          <p>
            In both HTML and SVG, <code>tabindex</code> is an important way browsers support keyboard <a href="#host_general_focus">focus navigation</a> for implementations of
            <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>; authoring and debugging tools can check to make sure <code>tabindex</code> values are properly set. For example, error
            conditions can include cases where more than one treeitem in a tree has a <code>tabindex</code> value greater than or equal to 0, where <code>tabindex</code> is not set on any treeitem, or
            where <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> is not defined when the element with the role tree has a <code>tabindex</code> value of greater than or equal to 0.

        <h2>Assistive Technologies</h2>
        <p>
          Programmatic access to accessibility semantics is essential for assistive technologies. Most assistive technologies interact with user agents, like other applications, through a recognized
          accessibility API. Perceivable objects in the user interface are exposed to assistive technologies as accessible objects, defined by the accessibility API interfaces. To do this properly,
          accessibility information – role, states, properties as well as contextual information – needs to be accurately conveyed to the assistive technologies through the accessibility API. When a
          state change occurs, the user agent provides the appropriate event notification to the accessibility API. Contextual information, in many host languages like HTML, can be determined from the
          <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> itself as it provides a contextual tree hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          While some assistive technologies interact with these accessibility APIs, others might access the content directly from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>. These technologies
          can restructure, simplify, style, or reflow the content to help a different set of users. Common use cases for these types of adaptations might be the aging population, persons with
          cognitive impairments, or persons in environments that interfere with use of their tools. For example, the availability of regional navigational landmarks can allow for a mobile device
          adaptation that shows only portions of the content at any one time based on its semantics. This could reduce the amount of information the user needs to process at any one time. In other
          situations it might be appropriate to replace a custom user interface control with something that is easier to navigate with a keyboard, or touch screen device.

              Live regions are perceivable regions of a web page that are typically updated as a result of an external event. These regions are not always updated as a result of a user interaction and
              can receive these updates even when they do not have focus. Examples of live regions include a chat log, stock ticker, or a sport scoring section that updates periodically to reflect
              game statistics. Since these asynchronous areas are expected to update outside the user's area of focus, assistive technologies such as screen readers have either been unaware of their
              existence or unable to process them for the user. WAI-ARIA has provided a collection of properties that allow the author to identify these live regions and process them: aria-live,
              aria-relevant, aria-atomic, and aria-busy.

        <p>
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> provides a collection of accessibility <a>states</a> and [=ARIA/properties=] which are used to support platform
          <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a> on various operating system platforms. <a>Assistive technologies</a> can access this information through an
          exposed <a>user agent</a> DOM or through a mapping to the platform accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr>. When combined with <a>roles</a>, the user agent
          can supply the assistive technologies with user interface information to convey to the user at any time. Changes in states or properties will result in a notification to assistive
          technologies, which could alert the user that a change has occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following example, a list item (<code>html:li</code>) has been used to create a checkable menu item, and JavaScript <a>events</a> will capture mouse and keyboard events to toggle the
          value of <sref>aria-checked</sref>. A role is used to make the behavior of this simple <a>widget</a> known to the user agent. [=attribute|Attributes=] that change with user actions (such as
          <sref>aria-checked</sref>) are defined in the <a href="#states_and_properties">states and properties</a> section.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight html">&lt;li role=&quot;menuitemcheckbox&quot; aria-checked=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Sort by Last Modified&lt;/li&gt;</pre>
        <p>
          Some accessibility states, called <em><a>managed states</a></em
          >, are controlled by the user agent. Examples of managed state include keyboard focus and selection. Managed states often have corresponding
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> pseudo-classes (such as <code>:focus</code> and <code>::selection</code>) to define style changes. In contrast, the states in this
          specification are typically controlled by the author and are called <em>unmanaged states.</em> Some states are managed by the user agent, such as <pref>aria-posinset</pref> and
          <pref>aria-setsize</pref>, but the author can override them if the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> is incomplete and would cause the user agent calculation to be incorrect.
          User agents map both managed and unmanaged states to the platform accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>.
        </p>

        <h2>Managing Focus and Supporting Keyboard Navigation</h2>
        <p>
          When using standard <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> interactive elements and simple <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a>widgets</a>,
          application developers can manipulate the tab order or associate keyboard shortcuts with elements in the document.
        </p>
        <p>
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> includes a number of &quot;managing container&quot; widgets, also known as &quot;composite&quot; widgets. When
          appropriate, the container is responsible for tracking the last descendant that was active (the default is usually the first item in the container). It is essential that a container maintain
          a usable and consistent strategy when focus leaves a container and is then later refocused. While there can be exceptions, it is recommended that when a previously focused container is
          refocused, the active descendant be the same element as the active descendant when the container was last focused. Exceptions include cases where the contents of a container widget have
          changed, and widgets like a menubar where the user expects to always return to the first item when focus leaves the menu bar. For example, if the second item of a tree group was the active
          descendant when the user tabbed out of the tree group, then the second item of the tree group remains the active descendant when the tree group gets focus again. The user can also activate
          the container by clicking on one of the descendants within it. When the container or its active descendant has focus, the user can navigate through the container by pressing additional keys,
          such as the arrow keys, to change the currently active descendant. Any additional press of the main navigation key (generally the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key) will move out of the container to the
          next widget.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usable keyboard navigation in a rich internet application is different from the tabbing paradigm among interactive elements, such as links and form controls, in a static document. In rich
          internet applications, the user tabs to significantly complex <a class="termref">widgets</a>, such as a menu or spreadsheet, and uses the arrow keys to navigate within the widget. The
          changes that <abbr title="accessible rich internet applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> introduces to keyboard navigation make this enhanced accessibility possible. In
          <abbr title="accessible rich internet applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, any element can be keyboard focusable. In addition to host language mechanisms such as <code>tabindex</code>,
          <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> provides another mechanism for keyboard operation. Most other aspects of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> widget
          development depend on keyboard navigation functioning properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          When implementing <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> as described below, the user agent keeps the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus on the container element or on an input
          element that controls the container element. However, the user agent communicates <a>desktop focus events</a> and states to the assistive technology as if the element referenced by
          <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> has focus. User agents are not expected to validate that the active descendant is a descendant of the container element. It is the responsibility of the
          user agent to ensure that keyboard events are processed at the <a>element</a> that has <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus. Any keyboard events directed at the active
          descendant bubble up to the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> element with focus for processing.
        </p>
        <section id="managingfocus_authors">
          <h3>Information for Authors</h3>
          <p>
            If the author removes the element with focus, the author SHOULD move focus to a logical element. Similarly, authors SHOULD not scroll the element with focus off screen unless the user
            performed a scrolling action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authors SHOULD ensure that all interactive [=elements=] are focusable and that all parts of composite widgets are either focusable or have a documented alternative method to achieve their
            function.
          </p>
          <p>Authors MUST manage focus on the following container roles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><rref>grid</rref></li>
            <li><rref>listbox</rref></li>
            <li><rref>menu</rref></li>
            <li><rref>menubar</rref></li>
            <li><rref>radiogroup</rref></li>
            <li><rref>tree</rref></li>
            <li><rref>treegrid</rref></li>
            <li><rref>tablist</rref></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            User agents that support <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> expand the usage of host language mechanisms such as <code>tabindex</code>, <code>focus</code>,
            and <code>blur</code> to allow them on all [=elements=]. Where the host language supports it, authors MAY add any element such as a <code>div</code>, <code>span</code>, or
            <code>img</code> to the default tab order by setting <code>tabindex=&quot;0&quot;</code>. In addition, any item with <code>tabindex</code> equal to a negative integer is focusable via
            script or a mouse click, but is not part of the default tab order. This is supported in both [[HTML]] and [[SVG2]].
          </p>
          <p>
            Authors MAY use <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> to inform <a>assistive technologies</a> which descendant of a <rref>widget</rref> element is treated as having keyboard focus in the user
            interface if the role of the widget element supports <code>aria-activedescendant</code>. This is often a more convenient way of providing keyboard navigation within widgets, such as a
            <rref>listbox</rref>, where the widget occupies only one stop in the page <kbd>Tab</kbd> sequence and other keys, typically arrow keys, are used to focus elements inside the widget.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, the author will use host language <a>semantics</a> to put the widget in the <kbd>Tab</kbd> sequence (e.g., <code>tabindex="0"</code> in HTML) and
            <code>aria-activedescendant</code> to point to the ID of the currently active descendant. The author, not the user agent, is responsible for styling the currently active descendant to show
            it has keyboard focus. The author cannot use <code>:<span class="css-selector">focus</span></code> to style the currently active descendant since the actual focus is on the container.
          </p>

          <h3>Information for User Agents</h3>
          <p>The user agent MUST do the following to implement <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Implement the host language method for keyboard navigation so that widgets that support <code>aria-activedescendant</code> can be included in the tab order.</li>
            <li>
              For platforms that expose <a>desktop focus</a> or <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></a> focus separately from
              <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus, do not expose the focused state in the accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for any element when
              it has <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus and also has <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> which points to a valid <a href="#valuetype_idref">ID reference</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute changes on an element that currently has <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus, remove the focused state from the
              previously focused object and fire an accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> <a>desktop focus event</a> on the new element referenced by
              <code>aria-activedescendant</code>. If <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> is cleared or does not point to an element in the current document, fire a desktop focus event for the
              <a>object</a> that had the attribute change.
            </li>
            <li>
              Apply the following accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> states to any element with an ID attribute that can be referenced by an element with both an
              <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute and has <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus. There are two ways an element can be referenced by
              <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>. One way is when it is an <a>accessibility descendant</a> of the element with <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> and the other is when it is an
              <a>accessibility descendant</a> of an element that is controlled by an element with role of <rref>combobox</rref>, <rref>textbox</rref> or <rref>searchbox</rref> with an
              <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Focusable, if the element also has a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a class="termref">role</a>. The element needs to be focusable because it
                  could be referenced by the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute. Native elements that have no <a class="termref">role</a> attribute do not need to be checked; their native
                  semantics determine the focusable state.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Focused, whenever the element is the target of the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute and the element with the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute has
                  <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus.

            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When an assistive technology uses its platform's accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> to request a change of focus, user agents MUST do the following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Remove the platform's focused state from the previously focused object.</li>
            <li>
              Set the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  If the <a class="termref">element</a> can take <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus, the <a class="termref">user agent</a> MUST set the
                  <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Otherwise, if the element being focused has an ID and the ID is referenced by the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute of an element that is focusable, the user agent MUST
                  set <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus to the element that has the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute.
                  <p class="note">
                    An element with an ID can be referenced when it is an <a>accessibility descendant</a> of a container element that has the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute or by a
                    container element that is controlled by an element that has the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute (e.g., see <rref>combobox</rref>). Otherwise the

          The Roles Model uses the following relationships to relate <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles to each other and to concepts from other specifications,
          such as HTML.

        <section id="superclassrole">

            The <a>role</a> that the current subclassed role extends in the Roles Model. This extension causes all the states and properties of the superclass role to propagate to the subclass role.
            Other than well known stable specifications, inheritance can be restricted to items defined inside this specification, so that external items cannot be changed and affect inherited
            classes.

          <h3>Related Concepts</h3>
          <p>
            Informative data about a similar or related idea from other specifications. Concepts that are related are not necessarily identical. Related concepts do not inherit properties from each
            other. Hence if the definition of one concept changes, the properties, behavior, and definition of its related concept is not affected.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a progress bar is like a status indicator. Therefore, the <rref>progressbar</rref> <a>widget</a> has a related concept which includes <rref>status</rref>. However, if the
            definition of <rref>status</rref> is modified, the definition of a <rref>progressbar</rref> is not affected.

            concepts are designed as a substitute for inheritance for external concepts. A base concept is like a <a href="#relatedConcept">related concept</a> except that the base concept is almost
            identical to the role definition.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, the <rref>checkbox</rref> defined in this document has similar functionality and anticipated behavior to a <code>&lt;input type="[^input/type/checkbox^]"&gt;</code> defined in
            HTML. Therefore, a <rref>checkbox</rref> has an [[HTML]] <code>checkbox</code> as a <code>baseConcept</code>. However, if the original [[HTML]] checkbox baseConcept definition is modified,
            the definition of a <rref>checkbox</rref> in this document will not be affected, because there is no actual inheritance of the respective type.

          </p>
          <p>To determine whether an element is the <a>child</a> of an element, <a>user agents</a> MUST ignore any intervening elements with the role <rref>generic</rref> or <rref>none</rref>.</p>
          <p>
            Descendants which are not children of an element ancestor are not constrained by <em>allowed accessibility child roles</em>. For example, an <code>image</code> is not an allowed child of a
            <code>list</code>, but it is a valid descendant if it is also a descendant of the <code>list</code>'s allowed child <code>listitem</code>.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            A role that has 'allowed accessibility child roles' does not imply the reverse relationship. Elements with roles in this list do not always have to be found within elements of the given
            role. See <a href="#scope">required accessibility parent roles</a> for requirements about the context where elements of a given role will be contained.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            An element with a <a href="#subclassroles">subclass role</a> of the 'allowed accessibility child role' does not fulfill this requirement. For example, the <rref>listbox</rref> role allows
            a child element using the <rref>option</rref> or <rref>group</rref> role. Although the <rref>group</rref> role is the superclass of <rref>row</rref>, adding a child element with a role of
            <rref>row</rref> will not fulfill the requirement that <rref>listbox</rref> allows children with <rref>option</rref> or <rref>group</rref> roles.
          </p>
          <p class="note">An element with the appropriate <a href="#implicit_semantics">implicit WAI-ARIA semantic</a> fulfills this requirement.</p>

        <p>Abstract roles are used for the ontology. Authors MUST NOT use abstract roles in content.</p>

            <p>A type of <a>live region</a> with important, and usually time-sensitive, information. See related <rref>alertdialog</rref> and <rref>status</rref>.</p>
            <p>
              Alerts are used to convey messages that might be immediately important to users. In the case of audio warnings, alerts provide an accessible alternative for hearing-impaired users. The
              <code>alert</code> <a>role</a> is applied to the element containing the alert message. An <code>alert</code> is a specialized form of the <rref>status</rref> role, which is processed as
              an atomic <a>live region</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alerts are assertive live regions, which means they cause immediate notification for assistive technology users. If the operating system allows, the <a>user agent</a> SHOULD fire a
              system alert <a>event</a> through the accessibility API when the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> alert is created.
            </p>
            <p>
              Neither authors nor user agents are required to set or manage focus to an alert in order for it to be processed. Since alerts are not required to receive focus, authors SHOULD NOT
              require users to close an alert. If an author desires focus to move to a message when it is conveyed, the author SHOULD use <rref>alertdialog</rref> instead of <code>alert</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elements with the role <code>alert</code> have an implicit <pref>aria-live</pref> value of <code>assertive</code>, and an implicit <pref>aria-atomic</pref> value of <code>true</code>.

            <p>
              Alert dialogs are used to convey messages to alert the user. The <code>alertdialog</code> <a>role</a> goes on the [=nodes|node=] containing both the alert message and the rest of the
              dialog. Authors SHOULD make alert dialogs modal by ensuring that, while the <code>alertdialog</code> is shown, keyboard and mouse interactions only operate within the dialog. See

            <p>
              Unlike <rref>alert</rref>, <code>alertdialog</code> can receive a response from the user. For example, to confirm that the user understands the alert being generated. When the alert
              dialog is displayed, authors SHOULD set focus to an active element within the alert dialog, such as a form control or confirmation button. The <a>user agent</a> SHOULD fire a system
              alert <a>event</a> through the accessibility API when the alert is created, provided one is specified by the intended

            </p>
            <p>Authors SHOULD provide an accessible name for an <code>alertdialog</code>, which can be done with the <pref>aria-label</pref> or <pref>aria-labelledby</pref> attribute.</p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD use <pref>aria-describedby</pref> on an <code>alertdialog</code> to reference the alert message element in the dialog. If they do not, an <a>assistive technology</a> can
              resort to its internal recovery mechanism to determine the contents of the alert message.

          <div class="role-description">
            <p>
              A <rref>structure</rref> containing one or more focusable elements requiring user input, such as keyboard or gesture events, that do not follow a standard interaction pattern supported
              by a <rref>widget</rref> role.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some [=user agents=] and <a>assistive technologies</a> have a browse mode where standard input events, such as up and down arrow key events, are intercepted and used to control a reading
              cursor. This browse mode behavior prevents elements that do not have a <rref>widget</rref> role from receiving and using such keyboard and gesture events to provide interactive
              functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              When there is a need to create an element with an interaction model that is not supported by any of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>
              <rref>widget</rref> roles, authors MAY give that element role <code>application</code>. And, when a user navigates into an element with role <code>application</code>,
              <a>assistive technologies</a> that intercept standard input events SHOULD switch to a mode that passes most or all standard input events through to the web application.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a presentation slide editor uses arrow keys to change the positions of textbox and image elements on the slide. There are not any WAI-ARIA <rref>widget</rref> roles that
              correspond to such an interaction model so an author could give the slide container role <code>application</code>, an <pref>aria-roledescription</pref> of &quot;Slide Editor&quot;, and
              use <pref>aria-describedby</pref> to provide instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because only the focusable elements contained in an <code>application</code> element are accessible to users of some assistive technologies, authors MUST use one of the following
              techniques to ensure all non-decorative static text or image content inside an application is accessible:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Associate the content with a focusable element using <pref>aria-labelledby</pref> or <pref>aria-describedby</pref>.</li>
              <li>Place the content in a focusable element that has role <rref>document</rref> or <rref>article</rref>.</li>
              <li>
                Manage focus of <a>accessibility descendants</a> as described in <a href="#managingfocus">Managing Focus</a>, updating the value of <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> to reference the
                <a>element</a> containing the focused content.

              An article is not a navigational <a>landmark</a>, but can be nested to form a discussion where assistive technologies could pay attention to article nesting to assist the user in
              following the discussion. An article could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a web log entry, a user-submitted comment, or any other independent item of content. It is
              <em>independent</em> in that its contents could stand alone, for example in syndication. However, the <a>element</a> is still associated with its ancestors; for instance, contact
              information that applies to a parent body element still covers the article as well. When nesting articles, the child articles represent content that is related to the content of the
              parent article. For instance, a web log entry on a site that accepts user-submitted comments could represent the comments as articles nested within the article for the web log entry.
              Author, heading, date, or other information associated with an article does not apply to nested articles.

              Buttons are mostly used for discrete actions. Standardizing the appearance of buttons enhances the user's recognition of the <a>widgets</a> as buttons and allows for a more compact

              Buttons support the optional <a>attribute</a> <sref>aria-pressed</sref>. Buttons with a non-empty <sref>aria-pressed</sref> attribute are toggle buttons. When
              <sref>aria-pressed</sref> is <code>true</code> the button is in a "pressed" <a>state</a>, when <sref>aria-pressed</sref> is <code>false</code> it is not pressed. If the attribute is not
              present, the button is a simple command button.

            <p>A cell containing header information for a column.</p>
            <p><code>columnheader</code> can be used as a column header in a table or grid. It could also be used in a pie chart to show a similar <a>relationship</a> in the data.</p>
            <p>
              The <code>columnheader</code> establishes a relationship between it and all cells in the corresponding column. It is the structural equivalent to an HTML <code>th</code>
              <a>element</a> with a column scope.
            </p>
            <p>Authors MUST ensure [=elements=] with <a>role</a> <code>columnheader</code> are the <a>accessibility children</a> of an element with the role <rref>row</rref>.</p>
            <p>
              Applying the <sref>aria-selected</sref> state on a columnheader MUST not cause the user agent to automatically propagate the <sref>aria-selected</sref> state to all the cells in the
              corresponding column. An author MAY choose to propagate selection in this manner depending on the specific application.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the <code>columnheader</code> role can be used in both interactive grids and non-interactive tables, the use of <pref>aria-readonly</pref> and <pref>aria-required</pref> is only
              applicable to interactive elements. Therefore, authors SHOULD NOT use <pref>aria-required</pref> or <pref>aria-readonly</pref> in a <code>columnheader</code> that descends from a
              <rref>table</rref>, and user agents SHOULD NOT expose either property to <a>assistive technologies</a> unless the <code>columnheader</code> descends from a <rref>grid</rref>.

            <p class="note">
              Because cells are organized into rows, there is not a single container element for the column. The column is the set of <rref>gridcell</rref> elements in a particular position within

              While <sref>aria-disabled</sref> is currently supported on <rref>columnheader</rref>, in a future version the working group plans to prohibit its use on elements with role
              <rref>columnheader</rref> except when the element is in the context of a <rref>grid</rref> or <rref>treegrid</rref>.

            <p class="ednote" title="Major Changes to combobox role in ARIA 1.2">
              The Guidance for <rref>combobox</rref> has changed significantly in ARIA 1.2 due to problems with implementation of the previous patterns. Authors and developers of User Agents,
              Assistive Technologies, and Conformance Checkers are advised to review this section carefully to understand the changes. Explanation of the changes is available in the
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria/wiki/Resolving-ARIA-1.1-Combobox-Issues">ARIA repository wiki</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              A <code>combobox</code> functionally combines a named input field with the ability to assist value selection via a supplementary popup element. A <code>combobox</code> input MAY be
              either a single-line text field that supports editing and typing or an element that only displays the current value of the <code>combobox</code>. If the <code>combobox</code> supports
              text input and provides autocompletion behavior as described in <pref>aria-autocomplete</pref>, authors MUST set <pref>aria-autocomplete</pref> on the <code>combobox</code> element to
              the value that corresponds to the provided behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typically, the initial state of a <code>combobox</code> is collapsed. In the collapsed state, only the <code>combobox</code> element and a separate, optional popup control
              <rref>button</rref> are visible. A <code>combobox</code> is said to be expanded when both the <code>combobox</code> element showing its current value and its associated popup element are
              visible. Authors MUST set <sref>aria-expanded</sref> to <code>true</code> on an element with role <code>combobox</code> when it is expanded and <code>false</code> when it is collapsed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Elements with the role <code>combobox</code> have an implicit <pref>aria-haspopup</pref> value of <code>listbox</code>. If the <code>combobox</code> popup element has a role other than
              <rref>listbox</rref>, authors MUST specify an <pref>aria-haspopup</pref> value of <rref>tree</rref>, <rref>grid</rref>, or <rref>dialog</rref> that corresponds to the role of its popup.
            </p>

              If the user interface includes an additional icon that allows the visibility of the popup to be controlled via pointer and touch events, authors SHOULD ensure that element has role
              <rref>button</rref>, that it is focusable but not included in the page <kbd>Tab</kbd> sequence, and that it is not a descendant of the element with role <code>combobox</code>. In
              addition, to be keyboard accessible, authors SHOULD provide keyboard mechanisms for moving focus between the <code>combobox</code> element and elements contained in the popup. For
              example, one common convention is that <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> moves focus from the input to the first focusable descendant of the popup element. If the popup element supports
              <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>, in lieu of moving focus, such keyboard mechanisms can control the value of <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> on the <code>combobox</code> element.
              When a descendant of the popup element is active, authors MAY set <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> on the <code>combobox</code> to a value that refers to the active element within the
              popup while focus remains on the <code>combobox</code> element.
            </p>
            <p>
              User agents MUST expose the value of elements with role <code>combobox</code> to <a>assistive technologies</a>. The value of a <code>combobox</code> is represented by one of the
              following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the <code>combobox</code> element is a host language element that provides a value, such as an HTML <code>input</code> element, the value of the combobox is the value of that
                element.
              </li>
              <li>
                Otherwise, the value of the <code>combobox</code> is represented by its descendant elements and can be determined using the same method used to compute the name of a
                <rref>button</rref> from its descendant content.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="ednote" title="Validity changes combobox for ARIA 1.2">
              Please review the following carefully. As a result of these changes a combobox following the ARIA 1.1 combobox specification will no longer conform with the ARIA specification.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>The structural requirements for <code>combobox</code> defined by this version of the specification are different from the requirements defined by ARIA 1.0 and ARIA 1.1:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The ARIA 1.0 specification required the input element with the <code>combobox</code> role to be a single-line text field and reference the popup element with
                  <pref>aria-owns</pref> instead of <pref>aria-controls</pref>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The ARIA 1.1 specification, which was not broadly supported by assistive technologies, required the <code>combobox</code> to be a non-focusable element with two required
                  <a>accessibility children</a> -- a focusable <rref>textbox</rref> and a popup element controlled by the <rref>textbox</rref>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The changes introduced in ARIA 1.2 improve interoperability with assistive technologies and enable authors to create presentations of combobox that more closely imitate a native HTML
                  <code>select</code> element.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              The features and behaviors of combobox implementations vary widely. Consequently, there are many important authoring considerations. See the
              <cite

                  <li>
                    Alternatively, if all ancestor comments are not in the DOM, such as when comments are paginated, the hierarchical level MAY be indicated via <pref>aria-level</pref>. Additional
                    group positional information MAY be indicated via <pref>aria-posinset</pref> and <pref>aria-setsize</pref>.

                  <li>Provide <pref>aria-details</pref> on the element containing the commented content with a value refering to the element with role <code>comment</code>.</li>
                  <li>
                    If there are multiple comments related to the same commented content, either provide a value for <pref>aria-details</pref> on the commented content that refers to each individual
                    comment, or use <pref>aria-details</pref> to refer to a parent container of the comments. If <pref>aria-details</pref> refers to an element containing comments rather than
                    <code>comment</code> elements, authors SHOULD assign a role of <rref>group</rref> or <rref>region</rref> to the referenced container.

          <div class="role-description">
            <p>A dialog is a descendant window of the primary window of a web application. For HTML pages, the primary application window is the entire web document.</p>
            <p>
              Dialogs are often used to prompt the user to enter or respond to information, or can represent content related to understanding or modifying the content of the primary application
              window. A dialog that is designed to interrupt workflow and prevent users from interacting with the primary web application is usually modal. See related <rref>alertdialog</rref>. A
              dialog that allows for the user to switch between interacting with the content of the primary web application and the content the dialog is usually modeless (i.e., non-modal). In lieu of
              using robust host language features for marking content of the primary web application as <code>inert</code>, authors SHOULD use the <pref>aria-modal</pref> attribute, and constrain
              focus to dialogs. See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/">WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices: Dialog (modal) pattern</a> for additional details on implementing
              modal dialog design patterns.
            </p>
            <p>Authors SHOULD provide an accessible name for a dialog, which can be done with the <pref>aria-label</pref> or <pref>aria-labelledby</pref> attribute.</p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD ensure that all dialogs (both modal and non-modal) have at least one focusable descendant element. Authors SHOULD focus an element in the modal dialog when it is
              displayed, and authors SHOULD constrain keyboard focus to focusable elements within a modal dialog, until dismissed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD provide a dialog an accessible description, with the <pref>aria-describedby</pref> attribute, for instances where authors have set initial keyboard focus on an element
              that follows content that outlines the purpose of the dialog. Assistive technology SHOULD give precedence to exposing author defined dialog accessible descriptions when a dialog is
              invoked and user focus is moved to a descendant of the dialog element.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>
                Authors are strongly encouraged to use <pref>aria-describedby</pref>, rather than <pref>aria-description</pref>, to provide descriptions to dialogs. While
                <code>aria-description</code> could be used to provide an accessible description for a dialog, it will provide a better and more consistent user experience to reference visible content
                that can also be independently read by all users. Doing so will help ensure important descriptive information is less likely to be missed.

              <p>
                In the following example, the first text field will receive initial focus when the dialog is rendered. As this means focus will be set "after" the preceding content that provides
                instructions for the form fields, an <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute is used to expose this content as a description for the <code>dialog</code>.

            <p class="note">
              As exposed by accessibility APIs, the <code>directory</code> <a>role</a> is essentially equivalent to the <code>list</code> <a>role</a>. So, using <code>directory</code> does not provide

              A <code>directory</code> is a static table of contents, whether linked or unlinked. This includes tables of contents built with lists, including nested lists. Dynamic tables of contents,

            <p>An <a>element</a> containing content that <a>assistive technology</a> users might want to browse in a reading mode.</p>
            <p>
              When <a>user agent</a> focus moves to an element assigned the role of <code>document</code>, <a>assistive technologies</a> having a reading mode for browsing static content MAY switch to
              that reading mode and intercept standard input events, such as Up or Down arrow keyboard events, to control the reading cursor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because <a>assistive technologies</a> that have a reading mode default to that mode for all elements except for those with either a <rref>widget</rref> or <rref>application</rref> role,
              the only circumstance where the <code>document</code> role is useful for changing assistive technology behavior is when the element with role <code>document</code> is a focusable child
              element of a <rref>widget</rref> or <rref>application</rref>. For example, given an <rref>application</rref> element which contains some static rich text, the author can apply role
              <code>document</code> to the element containing the text and give it a <code>tabindex</code> of <code>0</code>. When a screen reader user presses the Tab key and places focus on the
              <code>document</code> element, the user will be able to read the text with the screen reader's reading cursor.

          <div class="role-description">
            <p>
              A scrollable <rref>list</rref> of <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> where scrolling might cause <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> to be added to or removed from either end of
              the list.
            </p>
            <p>
              A <code>feed</code> enables users of <a>assistive technologies</a> that have a document browse mode, such as screen readers, to use the browse mode reading cursor to both read and scroll
              through a stream of rich content that might continue scrolling infinitely by loading more content as the user reads. In a <code>feed</code>, <a>assistive technologies</a> provide a web
              application with signals of the user's reading cursor movement by moving <a>user agent</a> focus, enabling the application to both add new content and visually position content as the
              user browses the page. The <code>feed</code> also lets authors inform assistive technologies when additions and removals are occurring so assistive technologies can more reliably update
              their reading view without disrupting reading or degrading performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, a <code>feed</code> could be used to present a stream of news stories where each <rref>article</rref> contains a story with text, links, images, and comments as well as
              widgets for sharing and commenting. As a screen reader user reads and interacts with each story and moves the screen reader reading cursor from story to story, each story scrolls into
              view and, as needed, new stories are loaded.
            </p>
            <p>
              A <code>feed</code> is a container element whose children have role <rref>article</rref>. When <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> are added or removed from either or both ends of a
              <code>feed</code>, authors SHOULD set <sref>aria-busy</sref> to <code>true</code> on the <code>feed</code> element before the changes are made and set it to <code>false</code> after the
              changes are complete. Authors SHOULD avoid inserting or removing <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> in the middle of a <code>feed</code>. These requirements help
              <a>assistive technologies</a> gracefully respond to changes in the <code>feed</code> content that occur simultaneously with user commands to move the reading cursor within the
              <code>feed</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD make each <rref>article</rref> in a <code>feed</code> focusable and ensure that the application scrolls an <rref>article</rref> into view when <a>user agent</a> focus is
              set on the <rref>article</rref> or one of its descendant elements. For example, in HTML, each <rref>article</rref> element should have a <code>tabindex</code> value of either
              <code>-1</code> or <code>0</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              When an <a>assistive technology</a> reading cursor moves from one <rref>article</rref> to another, <a>assistive technologies</a> SHOULD set user agent focus on the
              <rref>article</rref> that contains the reading cursor. If the reading cursor lands on a focusable element inside the <rref>article</rref>, the assistive technology MAY set focus on that
              element in lieu of setting focus on the containing <rref>article</rref>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the ability to scroll to another <rref>article</rref> with an <a>assistive technology</a> reading cursor depends on the presence of another <rref>article</rref> in the page,
              authors SHOULD attempt to load additional <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> before <a>user agent</a> focus reaches an <rref>article</rref> at either end of the set of
              <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> that has been loaded. Alternatively, authors MAY include an <rref>article</rref> at either or both ends of the loaded set of
              <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> that includes an element, such as a <rref>button</rref>, that lets the user request more <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> to be loaded.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to providing a brief label, authors MAY apply <pref>aria-describedby</pref> to <rref>article</rref> elements in a <code>feed</code> to suggest to screen readers which
              elements to speak after the label when users navigate by <rref>article</rref>. Screen readers MAY provide users with a way to quickly scan <code>feed</code> content by speaking both the
              label and <a class="informative">accessible description</a> when navigating by <rref>article</rref>, enabling the user to ignore repetitive or less important elements, such as embedded
              interaction widgets, that the author has left out of the description.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD provide keyboard commands for moving focus among <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> in a <code>feed</code> so users who do not utilize an assistive technology that
              provides <rref>article</rref> navigation features can use the keyboard to navigate the <code>feed</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the number of articles available in a <code>feed</code> supply is static, authors MAY specify <pref>aria-setsize</pref> on <rref>article</rref> elements in that <code>feed</code>.
              However, if the total number is extremely large, indefinite, or changes often, authors MAY set <pref>aria-setsize</pref> to <code>-1</code> to communicate the unknown size of the set.
            </p>

            <p>A nameless container <a>element</a> that has no semantic meaning on its own.</p>
            <p>
              The <code>generic</code> role is intended for use as the implicit role of generic elements in host languages (such as HTML <code>div</code> or <code>span</code>), so is primarily for
              implementors of user agents. Authors SHOULD NOT use this role in content. Authors MAY use <rref>presentation</rref> or <rref>none</rref> to remove implicit accessibility semantics, or a
              semantic container role such as <rref>group</rref> to semantically group descendants in a named container.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like an element with role <rref>presentation</rref>, an element with role <code>generic</code> can provide a limited number of accessible states and properties for its descendants, such
              as <pref>aria-live</pref> attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, unlike elements with role <code>presentation</code>, user agents expose <code>generic</code> elements in <a>accessibility APIs</a> when permitted accessibility attributes have
              been specified. User agents MAY otherwise ignore <code>generic</code> elements if such permitted attributes have not been specified.

          <div class="role-description">
            <p>
              A composite <rref>widget</rref> containing a collection of one or more rows with one or more cells where some or all cells in the grid are focusable by using methods of two-dimensional
              navigation, such as directional arrow keys.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>grid</code> role does not imply a specific visual, e.g., tabular, presentation. It describes <a>relationships</a> among [=elements=]. It can be used for purposes as simple as
              grouping a collection of checkboxes or navigation links or as complex as creating a full-featured spreadsheet application.
            </p>
            <p>
              The cell elements of a <code>grid</code> have role <rref>gridcell</rref>. Authors MAY designate a cell as a row or column header by using either the <rref>rowheader</rref> or
              <rref>columnheader</rref> <a>role</a> in lieu of the <rref>gridcell</rref> role. Authors MUST ensure elements with role <rref>gridcell</rref>, <rref>columnheader</rref>, or
              <rref>rowheader</rref> are <a>accessibility children</a> of elements with role <rref>row</rref>, which are in turn are <a>accessibility children</a> of an element with role
              <rref>rowgroup</rref>, or <code>grid</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be <a>keyboard accessible</a>, authors SHOULD manage focus of descendants of a <code>grid</code> as described in <a href="#managingfocus">Managing Focus</a>. When a user is navigating
              the <code>grid</code> content with a keyboard, authors SHOULD set focus as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If a <rref>gridcell</rref> contains a single interactive <rref>widget</rref> that will not consume arrow key presses when it receives focus, such as a <rref>checkbox</rref>,
                <rref>button</rref>, or <rref>link</rref>, authors MAY set focus on the interactive element contained in that cell. This allows the contained widget to be directly operable.
              </li>
              <li>Otherwise, authors SHOULD ensure the element that receives focus is a <rref>gridcell</rref>, <rref>rowheader</rref>, or <rref>columnheader</rref> element.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD provide a mechanism for changing to an interaction or edit mode that allows users to navigate and interact with content contained inside a focusable cell if that focusable
              cell contains any of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>a widget that requires arrow keys to operate, e.g., a <rref>combobox</rref> or <rref>radiogroup</rref></li>
              <li>multiple interactive elements</li>
              <li>editable content</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For example, if a cell in a spreadsheet contains a <rref>combobox</rref> or editable text, the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key might be used to activate a cell interaction or editing mode when that
              cell has focus so the directional arrow keys can be used to operate the contained <rref>combobox</rref> or <rref>textbox</rref>. Depending on the implementation, pressing
              <kbd>Enter</kbd> again, <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Escape</kbd>, or another key might switch the application back to the grid navigation mode.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MAY use a <rref>gridcell</rref> to display the result of a formula, which could be editable by the user. In a spreadsheet application, for example, a <rref>gridcell</rref> might
              show a value calculated from a formula until the user activates the <rref>gridcell</rref> for editing when a <rref>textbox</rref> appears in the <rref>gridcell</rref> containing the
              formula in an editable state.
            </p>
            <!-- make sure the following para remains synced with its counterpart in #treegrid -->
            <p>
              If <pref>aria-readonly</pref> is set on an element with role <code>grid</code>, [=user agents=] MUST propagate the value to all <rref>gridcell</rref> elements that are
              <a>accessibility descendants</a> of that <code>grid</code> and expose the value in the accessibility API. An author MAY override the propagated value of <pref>aria-readonly</pref> for an
              individual <rref>gridcell</rref> element.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a <code>grid</code> that provides cell content editing functions, if the content of a focusable <rref>gridcell</rref> element is not editable, authors MAY set
              <pref>aria-readonly</pref> to <code>true</code> on the <code>gridcell</code> element. However, the value of <pref>aria-readonly</pref>, whether specified for a <code>grid</code> or
              individual cells, only indicates whether the content contained in cells is editable. It does not represent availability of functions for navigating or manipulating the
              <code>grid</code> itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              An unspecified value for <pref>aria-readonly</pref> does not imply that a <code>grid</code> or a <rref>gridcell</rref> contains editable content. For example, if a
              <code>grid</code> presents a collection of elements that are not editable, such as a collection of <rref>link</rref> elements representing dates in a datepicker, it is not necessary for
              the author to specify a value for <pref>aria-readonly</pref>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MAY indicate that a focusable <rref>gridcell</rref> is selectable as the object of an action with the <sref>aria-selected</sref> attribute. If the <code>grid</code> allows
              multiple <rref>gridcell</rref>s to be selected, the author SHOULD set <pref>aria-multiselectable</pref> to <code>true</code> on the element with role <code>grid</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can augment an element of the host language, a <code>grid</code> can reuse the elements and attributes of a
              native table, such as an HTML <code>table</code> element. For example, if an author applies the <code>grid</code> role to an HTML <code>table</code> element, the author does not need to
              apply the <rref>row</rref> and <rref>gridcell</rref> roles to the descendant HTML <code>tr</code> and <code>td</code> elements because the <a>user agent</a> will automatically make the
              appropriate translations. When the author is reusing a native host language table element and needs a <rref>gridcell</rref> element to span multiple rows or columns, the author SHOULD
              apply the appropriate host language attributes instead of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <pref>aria-rowspan</pref> or
              <pref>aria-colspan</pref> properties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD provide an accessible name for a <code>grid</code>, which can be done with the <pref>aria-label</pref> or <pref>aria-labelledby</pref> attribute. Authors SHOULD reference
              a visible label with <pref>aria-labelledby</pref> if a visible label is present for the <code>grid</code>.
            </p>

              A <code>gridcell</code> can be focusable, editable, and selectable. A <code>gridcell</code> can have <a>relationships</a> such as <pref>aria-controls</pref> to address the application of

              If an author intends a <code>gridcell</code> to have a row header, column header, or both, and if the relevant headers cannot be determined from the

              Authors SHOULD use a <code>group</code> to form a logical collection of items in a <a>widget</a>, such as children in a tree widget forming a collection of siblings in a hierarchy.
              However, when a <code>group</code> is used in the context of a <rref>listbox</rref>, for example, authors MUST limit its children to <rref>option</rref> elements. Therefore, proper
              handling of <code>group</code> by authors and assistive technologies is determined by the context in which it is provided.

            <p>Content that represents a mathematical expression.</p>
            <p>
              Content with the role <code>math</code> is intended to be marked up in an accessible format such as <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/">MathML</a></cite> [[MathML3]], or with
              another type of textual representation such as TeX or LaTeX, which can be converted to an accessible format by native browser implementations or a polyfill library.
            </p>
            <p>
              While it is not ideal to use an image of a mathematical expression, there exists a significant amount of legacy content where images are used to represent mathematical expressions.
              Authors SHOULD ensure that images of math are labeled by text that describes the mathematical expression as it might be spoken.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>
                Browsers that support native implementations of MathML are able to provide a more robust, accessible math experience than can be accomplished with plain text approximations of math.
                Some rendering engines have close integration with screen readers that allow spacial touch exploration of the formula and refreshable braille display output in the
                <a>Nemeth Braille</a> format. This level of integration is not supported with images of mathematical formulas, even if the author provides a plain text approximation.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the time of this writing, some mainstream browsers do not support MathML natively, and must be retrofit using a JavaScript polyfill library. When authoring math content, use native
                MathML wherever possible, and test thoroughly. Use a polyfill library or provide a fallback image with a text alternative approximation if necessary.

              A menu is a container, generally rendered as a popup or overlay, for a set of menu items that can be invoked to perform an action or function. The function is almost always closely
              related or directly related to the element that the user activated to invoke the menu. Activating a menu item both performs the associated function of the menu item, and results in the
              automatic dismissal of the menu.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>menu</code> <a>role</a> is appropriate when a set of menu items is presented in a manner similar to a popup menu. For instance, a menu could be used to represent a context menu
              for its invoking element, or it would be used to render sub-menus for items of a <rref>menubar</rref> or another <code>menu</code> popup.
            </p>
            <p>To be <a>keyboard accessible</a>, authors SHOULD manage focus of descendants for all instances of this <a>role</a>, as described in <a href="#managingfocus">Managing Focus</a>.</p>
            <p>Elements with the role <code>menu</code> have an implicit <pref>aria-orientation</pref> value of <code>vertical</code>.</p>

              Note regarding the ARIA 1.1 <rref>none</rref> role.
              <p>
                In ARIA 1.1, the working group introduced <rref>none</rref> as a synonym to the <code>presentation</code> role, due to author confusion surrounding the intended meaning of the word
                "presentation" or "presentational." Many individuals erroneously consider <code>role="presentation"</code> to be synonymous with <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>, and we believe
                <code>role="none"</code> conveys the actual meaning more unambiguously.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              The intended use is when an element is used to change the look of the page but does not have all the functional, interactive, or structural relevance implied by the element type, or can
              be used to provide for an accessible fallback in older browsers that do not support <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.
            </p>
            <p>Example use cases:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>An element whose content is completely presentational (like a spacer image, decorative graphic, or clearing element);</li>
              <li>
                An image that is in a container with the <rref>img</rref> <a>role</a> and where the full text alternative is available and is marked up with <pref>aria-labelledby</pref> and (if
                needed) <pref>aria-describedby</pref>;
              </li>
              <li>An element used as an additional markup "hook" for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>; or</li>
              <li>A layout table and/or any of its associated rows, cells, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For any element with a role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> and which is not focusable, the user agent MUST NOT expose the implicit native semantics of the element (the
              role and its states and properties) to accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>. However, the user agent MUST expose content and descendant elements
              that do not have an explicit or inherited role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref>. Thus, the <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> role causes a given element to be
              treated as having no role or to be removed from the <a>accessibility tree</a>, but does not cause the content contained within the element to be removed from the accessibility tree.
            </p>
            <p>For example, the following two markup snippets will be exposed similarly to an accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>.</p>
            <pre
              class="example highlight html"
            ><span class="comment">&lt;!-- 1. role="none" negates the implicit 'heading' role semantics but does not affect the contents, including the nested hyperlink. --&gt;</span>
&lt;h1 role="none"&gt; Sample Content &lt;a href="...">let's go!&lt;/a> &lt;/h1&gt;

<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 2. A span has an implicit 'generic' role and no other attributes important to accessibility, so only its content is exposed, including the hyperlink. --&gt;</span>
&lt;span&gt; Sample Content &lt;a href="...">let's go!&lt;/a> &lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
            <p>
              In HTML, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> <a>element</a> is treated as a single entity regardless of the type of image file. Consequently, using <code>role="none"</code> or
              <code>role="presentation"</code> on an HTML <code>img</code> is equivalent to using <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>. In order to make the image contents accessible, authors can embed the
              object using an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> <a>element</a>, or use inline <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> code, and follow the
              accessibility guidelines for the image content.
            </p>
            <p>Authors SHOULD NOT provide a non-empty text alternative when the <code>none</code>/<code>presentation</code> role is applied to an image.</p>
            <p>
              In the following code sample, the containing <rref>img</rref> and is appropriately labeled by the caption paragraph. In this example the <code>img</code> element can be marked as
              <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> because the role and the text alternatives are provided by the containing element.
            </p>
            <pre class="example highlight html">
&lt;div role="img" aria-labelledby="caption"&gt;
  &lt;img src="example.png" role="none" alt=""&gt;
  &lt;p id="caption"&gt;A visible text caption labeling the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre
            >
            <p>
              In the following code sample, because the anchor (HTML <code>a</code> element) is acting as the treeitem, the list item (HTML <code>li</code> element) is assigned an explicit
              <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> to override the user agent's implicit native semantics for list
              items.
            </p>
            <pre class="example highlight html">
&lt;ul role="tree"&gt;
  &lt;li role="none"&gt;
	&lt;a role="treeitem" aria-expanded="true"&gt;An expanded tree node&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  …
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre

            <h5>Presentational Role Inheritance</h5>
            <p>
              The <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> role is used on an element that has implicit native semantics, meaning that there is a default accessibility
              <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> role for the element. Some elements are only complete when additional descendant elements are provided. For example, in HTML,
              table elements (matching the <rref>table</rref> role) require <code>tr</code> descendants (which have an implicit <rref>row</rref> <a>role</a>), which in turn require <code>th</code> or
              <code>td</code> children (the <rref>columnheader</rref> or <rref>rowheader</rref> and <rref>cell</rref> roles, respectively). Similarly, lists require list item children. The descendant
              elements that complete the semantics of an element are described in <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> as
              <a href="#mustContain">Allowed Accessibility Child Roles</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              When an explicit or inherited role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> is applied to an element with the implicit semantic of a
              <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role that has <a href="#mustContain">Allowed Accessibility Child Roles</a>, in addition to the element with the
              explicit role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref>, the user agent MUST apply an inherited role of <rref>none</rref> to any <a>accessibility descendants</a> that do not have an
              explicit role defined. Also, when an explicit or inherited role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> is applied to a host language element which has specifically allowed
              children as defined by the host language specification, in addition to the element with the explicit role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref>, the user agent MUST apply an
              inherited role of <rref>none</rref> to any specifically allowed children that do not have an explicit role defined.
            </p>
            <p>
              For any element with an explicit or inherited role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> and which is not focusable, user agents MUST ignore role-specific
              <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties for that element. For example, in HTML, a <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> element with a role
              of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> will have the implicit native semantics of its <code>li</code> elements removed because the <rref>list</rref> role to which the
              <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> corresponds has an <a href="#mustContain">Allowed Accessibility Child Role</a> of <rref>listitem</rref>. Likewise, the implicit native semantics of an
              HTML <code>table</code> element's <code>thead</code>/<code>tbody</code>/<code>tfoot</code>/<code>tr</code>/<code>th</code>/<code>td</code> descendants will also be removed, because the
              HTML specification indicates that these are required structural descendants of the <code>table</code> element.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              Only the implicit native semantics of elements that correspond to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>
              <a href="#mustContain">Allowed Accessibility Child Roles</a> are removed. All other content remains intact, including nested tables or lists, unless those elements also have an explicit
              role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> specified.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, according to an accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, the following markup elements might have identical or very similar role semantics
              (generic or none role) and identical content.
            </p>
            <pre class="example highlight html"><span class="comment">&lt;!-- 1. [role="none"] negates the implicit 'list' and 'listitem' role semantics but does not affect the contents. --&gt;</span>
&lt;ul role="none"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; More Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 2. There is no implicit role for "foo", so only the contents are exposed. --&gt;</span>
&lt;foo&gt;
  &lt;foo&gt; Sample Content &lt;/foo&gt;
  &lt;foo&gt; More Sample Content &lt;/foo&gt;
&lt;/foo&gt;</pre>
            <p class="note">
              There are other <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles with specific allowed children for which this situation is applicable (e.g., feeds and
              listboxes), but tables and lists are the most common real-world cases in which the none/presentation inheritance is likely to apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              For any element with an explicit or inherited role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref>, user agents MUST apply an inherited role of <rref>none</rref> to all
              host-language-specific labeling elements for the presentational element. For example, a <code>table</code> element with a role of <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> will have
              the implicit native semantics of its <code>caption</code> element removed, because the caption is merely a label for the presentational table.

            <p>
              A <code>note</code> is content provided by the author of the page or document, it is not to be used for providing reactions or suggestions. For these purposes, please review
              <rref>comment</rref> and <rref>suggestion</rref>.

            <p>
              When used within the normal flow of a page's content, a <code>note</code> has an implicit association with the content that it supplements. The following example demonstrates using a
              <code>note</code> to call out additional information in the natural reading order of a page:
            </p>
            <pre class="example highlight html">
					&lt;p>... the following results outline support for the tested features.&lt;/p>
					&lt;div role="note">
					  &lt;p>Please keep in mind that at the time of publishing this page all results were accurate.&lt;/p>
					  &lt;p>If you find any variations in results, please let us know!&lt;/p>
					&lt;/div>
					&lt;p>...&lt;/p>
				</pre
            >
            <p>
              In cases where an element with role <rref>note</rref> has been determined to need a programmatic association with the content it supplements, authors can use one of the following
              mechanisms to associate the elements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the <code>note</code> contains structured or interactive content (for example, a link, button, list, table, etc.) use <pref>aria-details</pref>.</li>
              <li>If the <code>note</code> is brief and consists of static text, use <pref>aria-describedby</pref>.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="example highlight html">
				  &lt;!-- using aria-details to reference a note containing a link -->
				  ...
					&lt;button aria-details="info-note">Get Started&lt;/button>

     the 1.1 branch and uncommented for the master branch (pending discussion and consensus).

				<p>An <rref>input</rref> for entering a password.</p>
				<div class="ednote">
					<p>The Working Group is still considering implications of the <code>password</code> role:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It might create security or privacy risks that custom password fields without the role would not;</li>
						<li>The use of such fields might not be widespread enough to justify the risks;</li>
						<li>Mitigating risks might require specific assisitve technology support that is not normally specified in ARIA.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The role has been included in this Working Draft to solicit wide review on these questions. The ARIA Working Group particularly seeks input from <strong>security</strong> and <strong>privacy</strong> experts, <strong>assistive technology</strong> developers, and <strong>authors</strong> who potentially would use the role.</p>
					<p>If input suggests excessive risks or insufficient need, the role might be removed from the next publication of this specification.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="warning">The <code>password</code> <a>role</a> does not convey or apply any of the security or privacy considerations found in native password fields. Authors are responsible for making sure that custom password fields have robust security and privacy protection, as befits their use.</p>
				<p>The <code>password</code> <a>role</a> makes it possible for <a>assistive technologies</a> to customize their behavior in order to not inadvertently expose private information. For instance, a screen reader which normally echoes key presses might instead remain silent or echo each displayed character as it is inserted. In order to facilitate the latter behavior, authors SHOULD set the <code>password</code> element's text to characters which obscure the real value, when that value is obscured on screen. Authors SHOULD also update that text each time a character is inserted or deleted by the user.</p>
				<p>In order to ensure that passwords will not be overheard during input, assistive technologies SHOULD NOT echo key presses of printable characters when an element with role <code>password</code> has focus, unless the user has explicitly enabled this option. If the user has enabled key echo, assistive technologies SHOULD present each rendered character as it is inserted rather than speaking a predetermined character, such as &quot;star.&quot; Presenting the rendered characters ensures that all users receive the same information, including notification when the value is being entered into an unobscured <code>password</code> field.</p>
				<p>Authors SHOULD limit the use of the <code>password</code> role to single-line [=elements=] which are editable. Authors MAY use the <code>password</code> role on elements which are not currently editable due to application-specific conditions. However, in that instance, authors MUST indicate that the element is read only by setting <pref>aria-readonly</pref> to <code>true</code> or using the appropriate native host language attribute. User agents MUST ignore the <code>password</code> role when it is applied to elements which are neither editable nor explicitly marked as read only. Host languages SHOULD document that the <code>password</code> role can only be used on elements that are editable and not permanently read only.</p>

              <p>
                In ARIA 1.1, the working group introduced <rref>none</rref> as the preferred synonym to the <rref>presentation</rref> role, due to author confusion surrounding the intended meaning of
                the word "presentation" or "presentational." Many individuals erroneously consider <code>role="presentation"</code> to be synonymous with <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>, and the ARIA
                Working Group believes <code>role="none"</code> conveys the actual meaning more unambiguously.

            <p>
              Authors MAY set <pref>aria-valuemin</pref> and <pref>aria-valuemax</pref> to indicate the minimum and maximum progress indicator values. Otherwise, their implicit values follow the same

            </ul>
            <p>
              The author SHOULD supply a <span>value</span> for <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> unless the value is indeterminate, in which case the author SHOULD omit the
              <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> attribute. Authors SHOULD update this value when the visual progress indicator is updated. If the <code>progressbar</code> is describing the loading progress
              of a particular region of a page, authors SHOULD both use <pref>aria-describedby</pref> to reference the progressbar status, and set the <sref>aria-busy</sref> attribute to
              <code>true</code> on the region until it is finished loading. It is not possible for the user to alter the value of a <code>progressbar</code> because it is always read-only.

            <p>A cell containing header information for a row.</p>
            <p>
              The <rref>rowheader</rref> role can be used to identify a cell as a header for a row in a <rref>table</rref>, <rref>grid</rref>, or <rref>treegrid</rref>. The rowheader establishes a
              <a>relationship</a> between it and all cells in the corresponding row. It is a structural equivalent to setting <code>scope="row"</code> on an HTML <code>th</code> <a>element</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Authors MUST ensure [=elements=] with <a>role</a> <code>rowheader</code> are <a>accessibility children</a> of an element with the role <rref>row</rref>.</p>
            <p>
              Applying the <sref>aria-selected</sref> state on a rowheader MUST NOT cause the user agent to automatically propagate the <sref>aria-selected</sref> state to all the cells in the
              corresponding row. An author MAY choose to propagate selection in this manner depending on the specific application.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the <code>rowheader</code> role can be used in both interactive grids and non-interactive tables, the use of <sref>aria-expanded</sref>, <pref>aria-readonly</pref>, and
              <pref>aria-required</pref> is only applicable to interactive elements. Therefore, authors SHOULD NOT use <sref>aria-expanded</sref>, <pref>aria-readonly</pref>, or
              <pref>aria-required</pref> in a <code>rowheader</code> that descends from a <rref>table</rref>, and user agents SHOULD NOT expose these properties to <a>assistive technologies</a> unless
              the <code>rowheader</code> descends from a <rref>grid</rref> or <rref>treegrid</rref>.

            <p class="note" title="Usage of aria-disabled">
              While <sref>aria-disabled</sref> is currently supported on <rref>rowheader</rref>, in a future version the working group plans to prohibit its use on elements with role
              <rref>rowheader</rref> except when the element is in the context of a <rref>grid</rref> or <rref>treegrid</rref>.

            <p>
              A scrollbar represents the current value and range of possible values via the size of the scrollbar and position of the thumb with respect to the visible range of the orientation
              (horizontal or vertical) it controls. Its orientation represents the orientation of the scrollbar and the scrolling effect on the viewing area controlled by the scrollbar. It is
              typically possible to add to or subtract from the current value by using directional keys such as arrow keys.
            </p>
            <p>Authors MUST set the <pref>aria-controls</pref> attribute on the scrollbar element to reference the scrollable area it controls.</p>
            <p>
              Authors MAY set <pref>aria-valuemin</pref> and <pref>aria-valuemax</pref> to indicate the minimum and maximum thumb position. Otherwise, their implicit values follow the same rules as

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>If <code>aria-valuemin</code> is missing or not a <a href="#valuetype_number">number</a>, it defaults to 0 (zero).</li>

            <p>
              Authors MUST set the <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> attribute to indicate the current thumb position. If aria-valuenow is missing or has an unexpected value, <a>user agents</a> MAY implement
              the repair techniques specified in the <a href="#authorErrorDefaultValuesTable">section describing handling author errors in states and properties</a>, which are equivalent to the repair
              techniques for <code>&lt;input type="[^input/type/range^]"&gt;</code> in HTML.
            </p>
            <p>Elements with the role <code>scrollbar</code> have an implicit <pref>aria-orientation</pref> value of <code>vertical</code>.</p>
            <p class="note">
              Assistive technologies generally will render the value of <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> as a percent of a range between the value of <pref>aria-valuemin</pref> and
              <pref>aria-valuemax</pref>, unless <pref>aria-valuetext</pref> is specified. It is best to set the values for <pref>aria-valuemin</pref>, <pref>aria-valuemax</pref>, and
              <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> in a manner that is appropriate for this calculation.

            <p>A divider that separates and distinguishes sections of content or groups of menuitems.</p>
            <p>
              There are two types of separators: a static <rref>structure</rref> that provides only a visible boundary and a focusable, interactive <rref>widget</rref> that is also moveable. If a
              <code>separator</code> is not focusable, it is revealed to <a>assistive technologies</a> as a static structural element. For example, a static <code>separator</code> can be used to help
              visually divide two groups of menu items in a menu or to provide a horizontal rule between two sections of a page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MAY make a <code>separator</code> focusable to create a <rref>widget</rref> that both provides a visible boundary between two sections of content and enables the user to change
              the relative size of the sections by changing the position of the <code>separator</code>. A variable <code>separator</code> widget can be moved continuously within a range, whereas a
              fixed <code>separator</code> widget supports only two discrete positions. Typically, a fixed <code>separator</code> widget is used to toggle one of the sections between expanded and
              collapsed states.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the <code>separator</code> is focusable, authors MUST set the value of <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> to a <a href="#valuetype_number">number</a> reflecting the current position of the
              <code>separator</code> and update that value when it changes. Authors SHOULD also provide the value of <pref>aria-valuemin</pref> if it is not <code>0</code> and the value of
              <pref>aria-valuemax</pref> if it is not <code>100</code>. If missing or not a number, the implicit values of these attributes are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The implicit value of <code>aria-valuemin</code> is <code>0</code>.</li>
              <li>The implicit value of <code>aria-valuemax</code> is <code>100</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In applications where there is more than one focusable <code>separator</code>, authors SHOULD provide an accessible name for each one.</p>
            <p>Elements with the role <code>separator</code> have an implicit <pref>aria-orientation</pref> value of <code>horizontal</code>.</p>

          <div class="role-description">
            <p>A form of <rref>range</rref> that expects the user to select from among discrete choices.</p>
            <p>
              A <code>spinbutton</code> typically allows users to change its displayed value by activating increment and decrement buttons that step through a set of allowed values. Some
              implementations display the value in an text field that allows editing and typing but typically limits input in ways that help prevent invalid values.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although a <code>spinbutton</code> is similar in appearance to many presentations of <code>select</code>, it is advisable to use <code>spinbutton</code> when working with known ranges
              (especially in the case of large ranges) as opposed to distinct options. For example, a <code>spinbutton</code> representing a range from 1 to 1,000,000 would provide much better
              performance than a <code>select</code> <a>widget</a> representing the same values.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MAY create a <code>spinbutton</code> with <a>accessibility children</a>, but MUST limit those elements to a <rref>textbox</rref> and/or two <rref title="button">buttons</rref>.
              Alternatively, authors MAY apply the <rref>spinbutton</rref> role to a text input and create sibling buttons to support the increment and decrement functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be <a>keyboard accessible</a>, authors SHOULD manage focus of descendants for all instances of this <a>role</a>, as described in <a href="#managingfocus">Managing Focus</a>. When a
              <code>spinbutton</code> receives focus, authors SHOULD ensure focus is placed on the <rref>textbox</rref> element if one is present, and on the <code>spinbutton</code> itself otherwise.
              Authors SHOULD also ensure the <kbd>up</kbd> and <kbd>down</kbd> arrows on a keyboard perform the increment and decrement functions and that the increment and decrement
              <rref>button</rref> elements are <em>NOT</em> included in the primary navigation ring, e.g., the Tab ring in HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD set the <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> attribute when the <rref>spinbutton</rref> has a value. Authors SHOULD set the <pref>aria-valuemin</pref> attribute when there is a
              minimum value, and the <pref>aria-valuemax</pref> attribute when there is a maximum value.

              The <code>table</code> role is intended for tabular containers which are not interactive. If the tabular container maintains a selection state, provides its own two-dimensional

              Authors SHOULD provide an accessible name for a <code>table</code>, which can be done with the <pref>aria-label</pref> or <pref>aria-labelledby</pref> attribute. Authors SHOULD reference
              a visible label with <pref>aria-labelledby</pref> if a visible label is present for the <code>table</code>.

				<p>An element whose entire subtree should be exposed to accessibility APIs as plain text.</p>
				<p>The <code>text</code> role allows authors to mark an element and all of its subtree contents as plain text.</p>
				<p>Authors SHOULD NOT use the <code>text</code> role on interactive controls (buttons, links, etc.) or ancestors of those controls, because it could prevent users of assistive technologies from accessing the controls. Authors wishing to retain the semantics of subtree contents could consider the ARIA 1.0 <rref>presentation</rref> or ARIA 1.1 <rref>none</rref> role instead.</p>
				<div class="note">
					<p>As with any ARIA 1.1 role, authors can provide a fallback ARIA 1.0 role.</p>
					<pre class="example highlight html">
						&lt;p&gt;I &lt;span role="text img" aria-label="love"&gt;♥︎&lt;/span&gt; New York.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;My &lt;span role="text img" aria-label="heart"&gt;♥︎&lt;/span&gt; bleeds.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;span role="text img" aria-label="3 of 5 stars"&gt;★★★☆☆︎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					</pre>
					<p>In a screen reader using an ARIA 1.1-capable browsers, the user would hear "I love New York." In an ARIA 1.0-capable browser, the user might hear "I, love image, New York."</p>
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<p>It is not necessary to use the fallback role if the implicit role for the element provides sufficient fallback. In this example, an ARIA 1.0-capable browser would not recognize the "text" role token, and fall back to the default image role.</p>
					<pre class="example highlight html">
						&lt;p&gt;I &lt;img src="icon.gif" alt="love" role="text"&gt; New York.︎&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;My &lt;img src="icon.gif" alt="heart" role="text"&gt; bleeds.︎&lt;/p&gt;
					</pre>
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<p>The text role can also be used to flatten structural semantics without providing an explicit label. The following example would be presented to assistive technologies as one static text element ("I like turtles") rather than three separate paragraphs.</p>
					<pre class="example highlight html">
						&lt;div role="text"&gt;
						  &lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;
						  &lt;p&gt;like&lt;/p&gt;
						  &lt;p&gt;turtles&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;
					</pre>
					<p>Use caution when using the text role on structural elements. In particular, avoid using the text role on elements with interactive descendants.</p>
					<pre class="example highlight html">
						&lt;p role="text"&gt;
						  &lt;!&dash;&dash; Example of incorrect usage. &dash;&dash;&gt;
						  This &lt;a href="#"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; becomes presentational, so
						  it is no longer a link. The paragraph is just plain text.
						  This is probably not what the author intended.

            <p>A type of input that allows free-form text as its value.</p>
            <p>
              If the <pref>aria-multiline</pref> <a>attribute</a> is <code>true</code>, the <a>widget</a> accepts line breaks within the input, as in an HTML <code>textarea</code>. Otherwise, this is
              a simple text box. The intended use is for languages that do not have a text input <a>element</a>, or cases in which an element with different <a>semantics</a> is repurposed as a text
              field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MUST limit the children of a textbox to non-interactive, entirely presentational elements such as icons used to visually convey information that is already exposed in an
              accessible manner. Examples include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>an error icon, where the containing textbox has been provided an <sref>aria-invalid</sref>, <sref>aria-errormessage</sref>, or both attributes;</li>
              <li>an icon of a user silhouette, where the textbox is also visibly labeled or provided an accessible name of "name" or "username"; and</li>
              <li>a graphical status indicator, such as a gauge to represent characters remaining, which represents dynamically updating text available outside of the textbox.</li>
            </ul>
            <!-- keep the following para synced with its equivalent in #aria-multiline -->
            <p class="note">
              In most user agent implementations, the default behavior of the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> or <kbd>RETURN</kbd> key is different between the single-line and multi-line text fields in HTML. When
              user has focus in a single-line <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> element, the keystroke usually submits the form. When user has focus in a multi-line
              <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> element, the keystroke inserts a line break. The <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <code>textbox</code> role
              differentiates these types of boxes with the <pref>aria-multiline</pref> attribute, so authors are advised to be aware of this distinction when designing the field.

              <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> tooltip is a supplement to the normal tooltip behavior of the user agent.
            </p>
            <p class="note">Typical tooltip delays last from one to five seconds.</p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD ensure that elements with the <a>role</a> <code>tooltip</code> are referenced through the use of <pref>aria-describedby</pref> before or at the time the tooltip is
              displayed.

        <h2>Clarification of States versus Properties</h2>
        <p>
          The terms "states" and "properties" refer to similar features. Both provide specific information about an <a>object</a>, and both form part of the definition of the nature of <a>roles</a>.
          In this document, states and properties are both treated as aria-prefixed markup [=attributes=]. However, they are maintained conceptually distinct to clarify subtle differences in their
          meaning. One major difference is that the <span>values</span> of properties (such as <pref>aria-labelledby</pref>) are often less likely to change throughout the application life-cycle than
          the values of states (such as <sref>aria-checked</sref>) which might change frequently due to user interaction. Note that the frequency of change difference is not a rule; a few properties,
          such as <pref>aria-valuetext</pref> are expected to change often. Because the distinction between states and properties is of little consequence to most authors, this specification refers to
          both "states" and "properties" simply as "attributes" whenever possible. See the definitions of <a class="termref" href="#dfn-state">state</a> and
          <a class="termref" href="#dfn-property">property</a> for more information.

            When the ARIA attribute definition includes a table listing the attribute's allowed <span>values</span>, that attribute is a multi-value nullable attribute. Each value in the table is a

            All ARIA attributes reflect in IDL as [=nullable type|nullable=] {{DOMString}} attributes. This includes the boolean-like <a href="#valuetype_true-false">true/false</a> type, and all other
            ARIA attributes.
          </p>

            <a data-cite="html/common-microsyntaxes.html#invalid-value-default">invalid value default</a> for the attribute. On getting, a missing ARIA attribute will return <code>null</code>. ARIA
            attributes are not validated on get. If an ARIA value is invalid, on getting, it will return its set value as a literal string, and will not return an invalid value default.

            Unlike IDL reflection, operating system accessibility API mappings of ARIA attributes can have defaults. Any default values from the ARIA values tables are exposed to the operating system

          <h3>ARIA nullable DOMString Attributes</h3>
          <p>As noted in [[[#typemapping]]], attributes are included in host languages, and the syntax for representation of WAI-ARIA types is governed by the host language.</p>
          <p>The following algorithm should be used for ARIA nullable {{DOMString}} attributes in HTML:</p>
          <p>
            On getting, if the corresponding content attribute is not present, then the IDL attribute must return null, otherwise, the IDL attribute must get the value in a transparent,
            case-preserving manner. On setting, if the new value is null, the content attribute must be removed, and otherwise, the content attribute must be set to the specified new value in a
            transparent, case-preserving manner.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            Note: As of ARIA 1.2, all ARIA attributes exposed via IDL are defined as nullable {{DOMString}}s. This matches the current implementation of all major rendering engines. This specification
            change should result in no implementation changes; it will merely represent the current reality of web engines. However, in a future draft, the ARIA Working Group intends to change several
            ARIA attributes to non-nullable DOMStrings, and seek implementations. The proposed change will bring ARIA into alignment with the HTML’s usage of

              The <code>aria-activedescendant</code> property provides an alternative method of managing focus for interactive elements that might contain multiple focusable descendants, such as
              menus, grids, and toolbars. Instead of moving DOM focus among <a>accessibility descendants</a>, authors MAY set DOM focus on a container <a>element</a> that supports
              <code>aria-activedescendant</code> and then use <code>aria-activedescendant</code> to refer to the element that is active.
            </p>
            <p>Authors MUST ensure that one of the following two sets of conditions is met when setting the value of <code>aria-activedescendant</code> on an element with DOM focus:</p>

                <code>aria-activedescendant</code>, and the value of <code>aria-activedescendant</code> refers to an <a>accessibility descendant</a> of the controlled element. For example, in a
                <rref>combobox</rref>, focus can remain on the <rref>combobox</rref> while the value of <code>aria-activedescendant</code> on the <rref>combobox</rref> element refers to a descendant

              </li>
              <li>
                If <pref>aria-atomic</pref> is explicitly set to <code>false</code>, assistive technologies will stop searching up the ancestor chain and present only the changed node to the user.

              <li>
                If <pref>aria-atomic</pref> is explicitly set to <code>true</code>, assistive technologies will present the entire contents of the element, including the author-defined live region
                label if one exists.

            </ol>
            <p>When <pref>aria-atomic</pref> is <code>true</code>, assistive technologies can choose to combine several changes and present the entire changed region at once.</p>

          <div class="property-description">
            <p>
              <a>Indicates</a> whether inputting text could trigger display of one or more predictions of the user's intended value for a <rref>combobox</rref>, <rref>searchbox</rref>, or
              <rref>textbox</rref> and specifies how predictions would be presented if they were made.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>aria-autocomplete</code> property describes the type of interaction model a <rref>textbox</rref>, <rref>searchbox</rref>, or <rref>combobox</rref> employs when dynamically
              helping users complete text input. It distinguishes between two models: the inline model (<code>aria-autocomplete="inline"</code>) that presents a value completion prediction inside the
              text input and the list model (<code>aria-autocomplete="list"</code>) that presents a collection of possible values in a separate element that pops up adjacent to the text input. It is
              possible for an input to offer both models at the same time (<code>aria-autocomplete="both"</code>).
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>aria-autocomplete</code> property is limited to describing predictive behaviors of an input element. Authors SHOULD either omit specifying a value for
              <code>aria-autocomplete</code> or set <code>aria-autocomplete</code> to <code>none</code> if an input element provides one or more input proposals where none of the proposals are
              dependent on the specific input provided by the user. For instance, a combobox where the value of <code>aria-autocomplete</code> would be <code>none</code> is a search field that
              displays suggested values by listing the 5 most recently used search terms without any filtering of the list based on the user's input. Elements with a role that supports
              <code>aria-autocomplete</code> have a default value for <code>aria-autocomplete</code> of <code>none</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              When an inline suggestion is made as a user types in an input, suggested text for completing the value of the field dynamically appears in the field after the input cursor, and the
              suggested value is accepted as the value of the input if the user performs an action that causes focus to leave the field. When an element has <code>aria-autocomplete</code> set to
              <code>inline</code> or <code>both</code>, authors SHOULD ensure that the automatically suggested portion of the text is presented as selected text. This enables assistive technologies to
              distinguish between a user's input and the automatic suggestion and, in the event that the suggestion is not the desired value, enables the user to easily delete the suggestion or
              replace it by continuing to type.
            </p>
            <p>If an element has <code>aria-autocomplete</code> set to <code>list</code> or <code>both</code>, authors MUST ensure both of the following conditions are met:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The element has a value specified for <pref>aria-controls</pref> that refers to the element that contains the collection of suggested values.</li>
              <li>The element has a value for <pref>aria-haspopup</pref> that matches the role of the element that contains the collection of suggested values.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Some implementations of the list model require the user to perform an action, such as moving focus to the suggestion with the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> or clicking on the suggestion, in
              order to choose the suggestion. In such implementations, authors MAY manage focus by either using <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> if the collection container supports it or by moving
              DOM focus to the suggestion. However, other implementations of the list model automatically highlight one suggestion as the selected value that will be accepted when the field loses
              focus, e.g., when the user presses the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or clicks on a different field. If an element has <code>aria-autocomplete</code> set to <code>list</code> or <code>both</code>,
              and if a suggestion is automatically selected as the user provides input, authors MUST ensure all the following conditions are met:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The collection of suggestions is presented in an element with a role that supports <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>.</li>
              <li>
                The value of <code>aria-activedescendant</code> set on the input field is dynamically adjusted to refer to the element containing the selected suggestion as described in the definition
                of <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>.
              </li>
              <li>DOM focus remains on the text input while the suggestions are displayed.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The <code>aria-autocomplete</code> property is not intended to indicate the presence of a completion suggestion, and authors SHOULD NOT dynamically change its value in order to
              communicate the presence of a suggestion. When an element has <code>aria-autocomplete</code> set to <code>list</code> or <code>both</code>, authors SHOULD use the
              <sref>aria-expanded</sref> state to communicate whether the element that presents the suggestion collection is displayed.

              Note that <a>Assistive Technologies</a> with braille support can convert the accessible name to Braille. In addition, assistive technologies will be able to customize such braille output
              according to user preferences. Using only the accessible name, e.g., from content or via <code>aria-label</code> is <strong>almost always</strong> the better user experience and authors
              are <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> from using <code>aria-braillelabel</code> to replicate <code>aria-label</code>. Instead, <code>aria-braillelabel</code> is meant to be used only
              if the accessible name cannot provide an adequate braille representation, i.e., when a specialized braille description is very different from a text description converted to Braille. It
              is very important to note that when using <code>aria-braillelabel</code>, authors are solely responsible for localizing the attribute value so that it aligns with the document language.
              In addition, authors need to design a way to clearly communicate the use of this attribute to the user. For example, this could be done in the product documentation. This is even more
              important when the value consists of Unicode Braille Patterns because <a>Assistive Technologies</a> will pass such content directly to the user without applying user specific braille
              translations; in general, authors are <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> from using Unicode Braille Patterns in <code>aria-braillelabel</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a>Assistive technologies</a> SHOULD use the value of <code>aria-braillelabel</code> when presenting the accessible name of an element in Braille, but SHOULD NOT change other
              functionality. For example, an assistive technology that provides aural rendering SHOULD use the accessible name.
            </p>
            <p><a>Assistive technologies</a> SHOULD expose the <code>aria-braillelabel</code> property as follows:</p>
            <ol>

              Note that <a>Assistive Technologies</a> with braille support can convert <code>aria-roledescription</code> content to Braille. In addition, assistive technologies will be able to
              customize such braille output according to user preferences. Using only <code>aria-roledescription</code> is <strong>almost always</strong> the better user experience and authors are
              <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> from using <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> to replicate <code>aria-roledescription</code>. Instead,
              <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> is meant to be used only when <code>aria-roledescription</code> cannot provide an adequate braille representation, i.e., when a specialized
              braille description is very different from a text description converted to Braille. It is very important to note that when using <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code>, authors are
              solely responsible for localizing the attribute value so that it aligns with the document language. In addition, authors need to design a way to clearly communicate the use of this
              attribute to the user. For example, this could be done in the product documentation. This is even more important when the value consists of Unicode Braille Patterns because
              <a>Assistive Technologies</a> will pass such content directly to the user without applying user specific braille translations; in general, authors are
              <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> from using Unicode Braille Patterns in <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code>.
            </p>
            <p>User agents MUST NOT expose the <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> property if any of the following conditions exist:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The value of <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> is empty or contains only whitespace characters, which includes standard [=ascii whitespace|whitespace=] and the empty Braille
                pattern: dots-0 (U+2800).
              </li>
              <li>
                The element to which <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> is applied has an explicit or implicit WAI-ARIA role where <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> is
                <a href="#prohibitedattributes">prohibited</a>.
              </li>
              <li>The element to which <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> is applied does not have a valid WAI-ARIA <code>aria-roledescription</code>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <a>Assistive technologies</a> SHOULD use the value of <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> when presenting the role of an element in Braille, but SHOULD NOT change other
              functionality based on the role of an element that has a value for <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code>. For example, an assistive technology that provides functions for navigating
              to the next <rref>region</rref> or <rref>button</rref> SHOULD allow those functions to navigate to regions and buttons that have an <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code>.
            </p>
            <p><a>Assistive technologies</a> SHOULD expose the <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> property as follows:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                If the value of <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> does not contain characters in <a>Unicode Braille Patterns</a>, translate the value according to the user's preferred
                translation table.
              </li>
              <li>Otherwise, pass the value to the user without translation.</li>

              The following two examples show the use of <code>aria-brailleroledescription</code> to abbreviate the role of a repeated non-interactive "slide" container in a web-based presentation
              application.

            <p>
              The default value of <code>aria-busy</code> is <code>false</code> for all elements. When <code>aria-busy</code> is <code>true</code> for an element, assistive technologies can ignore
              changes to content that is an <a>accessibility descendant</a> that element and then process all changes made during the busy period as a single, atomic update when
              <code>aria-busy</code> becomes <code>false</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If it is necessary to make multiple additions, modifications, or removals within a container element that is already either partially or fully rendered, authors MAY set
              <code>aria-busy</code> to <code>true</code> on the container element before the first change, and then set it to <code>false</code> when the last change is complete. For example, if
              multiple changes to a <a>live region</a> should be spoken as a single unit of speech, authors MAY set <code>aria-busy</code> to <code>true</code> while the changes are being made and
              then set it to <code>false</code> when the changes are complete and ready to be spoken.
            </p>
            <p>
              If an element with role <rref>feed</rref> is marked busy, assistive technologies might defer rendering changes that occur inside the <code>feed</code> with the exception of
              user-initiated changes that occur inside the <rref>article</rref> that the user is reading during the busy period.
            </p>
            <p>
              If changes to a rendered <rref>widget</rref> would create a state where the <rref>widget</rref> is modifying <a href="#mustContain">Allowed Accessibility Child Roles</a> during script
              execution, authors MAY set <code>aria-busy</code> to <code>true</code> on the <rref>widget</rref> during the update process. For example, if a rendered tree grid required a set of
              simultaneous updates to multiple discontiguous branches, an alternative to replacing the complete tree element with a single update would be to mark the tree busy while each of the
              branches are modified.

              If all of the columns are present in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>, it is not necessary to set this <a>attribute</a> as the <a>user agent</a> can automatically
              calculate the column index of each cell or <rref>gridcell</rref>. However, if only a portion of the columns is present in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> at a given
              moment, this attribute is needed to provide an explicit indication of the column of each cell or gridcell with respect to the full table.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MUST set the <span>value</span> for <pref>aria-colindex</pref> to an integer greater than or equal to 1, greater than the <pref>aria-colindex</pref> value of any previous
              elements within the same row, and less than or equal to the number of columns in the full table. For a cell or gridcell which spans multiple columns, authors MUST set the value of
              <pref>aria-colindex</pref> to the start of the span.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the set of columns which is present in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> is contiguous, and if there are no cells which span more than one row or column in that set,
              then authors MAY place <pref>aria-colindex</pref> on each row, setting the value to the index of the first column of the set. Otherwise, authors SHOULD place
              <pref>aria-colindex</pref> on all of the <a>accessibility children</a> of each row.

              The following example shows a grid with 16 columns, of which columns 2 through 5 are displayed to the user. Because the set of columns is contiguous, <pref>aria-colindex</pref> can be

            <p>
              The <code>aria-controls</code> property is for referencing elements that are modified by the user interacting with the currently focused element or composite widget. The presence of
              <code>aria-controls</code> enables <a>assistive technologies</a> to programmatically associate the currently focused element with the element or elements it controls. For instance, it
              can be used to inform users that by interacting with the controlling element they have revealed an element or elements that were previously in the hidden state. Or, by interacting with
              an element, they caused the selection or value of a controlled element to change.
            </p>
            <p>Instance where an <code>aria-controls</code> association could be made:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Interacting with a text field or editable combobox results in the display of a listbox popup. Upon entering text, the associated listbox is filtered, or the selected option changes to
                match the text value entered by the user.
              </li>
              <li>A tree view representing a table of contents where choosing a treeitem updates content of a neighboring document pane.</li>
              <li>A series of checkboxes can each control what commodity prices are tracked live in a table or graph.</li>
              <li>
                An interactive element reveals associated content when selected. For instance, selecting a tab control reveals its associated tab panel. Or checking a radio button reveals additional
                information or form controls related to the chosen radio button.
              </li>
              <li>Radio buttons allow for filtering to a listing of search results.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Additionally, the <code>aria-controls</code> property supports multiple ID references. For example, a control can be used to highlight different instances of spelling errors. A user
              agent MAY convey to a user that there are a number of related controlled elements (the misspellings), allow the user to navigate to the controlled elements in sequence, or both.

              The <sref>aria-current</sref> <a>attribute</a> is a token type. Any value not included in the list of allowed values SHOULD be treated by <a>assistive technologies</a> as if the value

            <p>The <sref>aria-current</sref> attribute is used when an element within a set of related elements is visually styled to indicate it is the current item in the set. For example:</p>

              Authors SHOULD NOT use the <sref>aria-current</sref> attribute as a substitute for <sref>aria-selected</sref> in widgets where <sref>aria-selected</sref> has the same meaning. For
              example, in a <rref>tablist</rref>, <sref>aria-selected</sref> is used on a <rref>tab</rref> to indicate the currently-displayed <rref>tabpanel</rref>.

            <p class="note">
              In some use cases for widgets that support <sref>aria-selected</sref>, current and selected can have different meanings and can both be used within the same set of elements. For example,
              <code>aria-current="page"</code> can be used in a navigation <rref>tree</rref> to indicate which page is currently displayed, while <code>aria-selected="true"</code> indicates which page
              will be displayed if the user activates the <rref>treeitem</rref>. Furthermore, the same tree can support operating on one or more selected pages (treeitems) by way of a context menu
              containing options such as "delete" and "move."

            <p><a>Defines</a> a string value that describes or annotates the current element. See related <pref>aria-describedby</pref>.</p>
            <p>
              The <pref>aria-description</pref> attribute is similar to <pref>aria-label</pref> in that both provide a flat string to associate with the element (an accessible description, and name,
              respectively). Unlike an accessible name, which is generally preferred to be concise, a description can provide more verbose information, as necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              The purpose of <pref>aria-description</pref> is the same as that of <pref>aria-describedby</pref>. It provides the user with additional descriptive text for the object. The most common
              <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></a> mapping for a description is the <a class="informative">accessible description</a> property. User agents
              MUST give precedence to <pref>aria-describedby</pref> over <pref>aria-description</pref> when computing the accessible description property.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cases where providing a visible description is not the desired user experience, authors MAY set the accessible description of the element using <pref>aria-description</pref>. However,
              if the description text is available in the DOM, authors SHOULD NOT use <pref>aria-description</pref>, but should use one of the following instead:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Authors SHOULD use <pref>aria-describedby</pref> when the related description or annotation elements contain a simple, small description that is best experienced as a flat string,
                rather than by having the user navigate to them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Authors SHOULD use <pref>aria-details</pref> when the related description or annotation elements contain useful semantics or structure, or there is a lot of content within them, making
                it difficult to experience as a flat string. Using <pref>aria-details</pref> will allow assistive technology users to visit the structured content and provide additional navigation
                commands, making it easier to understand the structure, or to experience the information in smaller pieces.

            <p>
              The <code>aria-details</code> property is for referencing elements that provide more detailed information than would normally be provided via <pref>aria-describedby</pref>. The presence
              of <code>aria-details</code> enables <a>assistive technologies</a> to make users aware of the availability of extended information and navigate to it. Authors SHOULD ensure that elements
              referenced by <code>aria-details</code> are visible to all users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Assistive technologies can use the role of elements referenced by the <code>aria-details</code> property to help users understand the types of information associated with the element.
              Authors MAY convey the type of details associated with an element as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Comment: <code>aria-details</code> refers to an element with role <rref>comment</rref>.</li>
              <li>Definition: <code>aria-details</code> is applied to an element with role <rref>term</rref> and refers to an element with role <rref>definition</rref>.</li>
              <li>
                Caption: <code>aria-details</code> is applied to an element with role <rref>figure</rref> and refers to an element with role <rref>caption</rref>, or an element within a
                <code>caption</code>.
              </li>
              <li>Footnote: <code>aria-details</code> refers to an element with role <code>doc-footnote</code>. This role is defined in [[DPUB-ARIA-1.0]].</li>
              <li>Endnote: <code>aria-details</code> refers to an element with role <code>doc-endnote</code>. This role is defined in [[DPUB-ARIA-1.0]].</li>
              <li>Description or general annotation: <code>aria-details</code> refers to an element with any other role.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Unlike elements referenced by <code>aria-describedby</code>, elements referenced by <code>aria-details</code> are not used in the Accessible Description Computation as defined in the
              <cite><a href="" class="accname">Accessible Name and Description Computation</a></cite> [[ACCNAME-1.2]]. Thus, the content of elements referenced by <code>aria-details</code> are not
              flattened to a string when presented to assistive technology users. This makes <code>aria-details</code> particularly useful when converting the information to a string would cause a
              loss of information or make the extended information more difficult to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>aria-details</code> property supports referring to multiple elements. For example, a paragraph in a document editor might reference multiple comments that are not related to
              each other. If a user agent relies on an accessibility API that does not support exposing multiple descriptive relations, the user agent SHOULD expose the relationship to the first
              element referenced by <code>aria-details</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is valid for an element to have both <code>aria-details</code> and a description specified with either <code>aria-describedby</code> or <code>aria-description</code>. If a user agent
              relies on an accessibility API that does not support exposing multiple descriptive relations, and if an element has both <code>aria-details</code> and <rref>aria-describedby</rref>, the
              user agent SHOULD expose the <code>aria-details</code> relation and the description string computed from the <rref>aria-describedby</rref> relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
              A common use for <code>aria-details</code> is in digital publishing where an extended description needs to be conveyed in a book that requires structural markup or the embedding of other
              technology to provide illustrative content. The following example demonstrates this scenario.

                                    The Pythagorean Theorem is a relationship in Euclidean Geometry between the three sides of
                                    a right triangle, where the square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the squares of the two
                                    opposing sides.
                                  &lt;/p&gt;
                                  &lt;p&gt;
                                    The following drawing illustrates an application of the Pythagorean Theorem when used to
                                    construct a skateboard ramp.
                                  &lt;/p&gt;
                                  &lt;object data="skatebd-ramp.svg"  type="image/svg+xml"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
                                  &lt;p&gt;
                                    In this example you will notice a skateboard ramp with a base and vertical board whose width
                                    is the width of the ramp. To compute how long the ramp must be, simply calculate the
                                    base length, square it, sum it with the square of the height of the ramp, and take the
                                    square root of the sum.
                                  &lt;/p&gt;

              For example, irrelevant options in a radio group can be disabled. Disabled elements might not receive focus from the tab order. For some disabled elements, applications might choose not
              to support navigation to descendants. In addition to setting the <sref>aria-disabled</sref> attribute, authors SHOULD change the appearance (grayed out, etc.) to indicate that the item

              The <code>aria-dropeffect</code> property is expected to be replaced by a new feature in a future version of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. Authors

              This [=ARIA/property=] allows assistive technologies to convey the possible drag options available to users, including whether a pop-up menu of choices is provided by the application.
              Typically, drop effect functions can only be provided once an object has been grabbed for a drag operation as the drop effect functions available are dependent on the object being
              dragged.
            </p>
            <p>
              More than one drop effect can be supported for a given <a>element</a>. Therefore, the value of this <a>attribute</a> is a space-separated set of tokens indicating the possible effects,
              or <code>none</code> if there is no supported operation. In addition to setting the <pref>aria-dropeffect</pref> attribute, authors SHOULD show a visual indication of potential drop
              targets.

              <code>aria-errormessage</code> on an object that is currently valid, but only if the elements referenced by <code>aria-errormessage</code> are [=element/hidden from all users=], because
              the message they contain is not pertinent.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <code>aria-errormessage</code> is pertinent, authors MUST ensure the content is not [=element/hidden from all users=] so users can navigate to and examine the error message.
              Similarly, when <code>aria-errormessage</code> is not pertinent, authors MUST either ensure the content is [=element/hidden from all users=] or remove the
              <code>aria-errormessage</code> attribute or its value.

              Authors MAY call attention to a newly rendered error message with a live region by either applying an <pref>aria-live</pref> property or using one of the
              <a href="#live_region_roles">live region roles</a>, such as <rref>alert</rref>. A live region is appropriate when an error message is displayed to users after they have provided an

              A typical message describes what is wrong and informs users what is required. For example, an error message might be,
              <q>Invalid time: the time must be between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM.</q> The following example code shows markup for an initial valid state and for a subsequent invalid state. Note the changes
              to <sref>aria-invalid</sref> on the text input <a>object</a>, and to <pref>aria-live</pref> on the <a>element</a> containing the text of the error message:

            <p><a>Indicates</a> the availability and type of interactive popup element, such as menu or dialog, that can be triggered by an <a>element</a>.</p>
            <p>
              A popup element usually appears as a block of content that is on top of other content. Authors MUST ensure that the role of the element that serves as the container for the popup content
              is <rref>menu</rref>, <rref>listbox</rref>, <rref>tree</rref>, <rref>grid</rref>, or <rref>dialog</rref>, and that the value of <code>aria-haspopup</code> matches the role of the popup
              container.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the popup element to be keyboard accessible, authors SHOULD ensure that the element that can trigger the popup is focusable, that there is a keyboard mechanism for opening the popup,
              and that the popup element manages focus of all its descendants as described in <a href="#managingfocus">Managing Focus</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>aria-haspopup</code> property is a token type. [=User agents=] MUST treat any value of <code>aria-haspopup</code> that is not included in the list of allowed values, including
              the empty string, as if the value <code>false</code> had been provided. To provide backward compatibility with ARIA 1.0 content, user agents MUST treat an
              <code>aria-haspopup</code> value of <code>true</code> as equivalent to a value of <code>menu</code>.
            </p>
            <p><a>Assistive technologies</a> and user agents SHOULD NOT expose the <code>aria-haspopup</code> property if it has a value of <code>false</code>.</p>
            <p class="note">A <rref>tooltip</rref> is not considered to be a popup in this context.</p>
            <p class="note">
              <code>aria-haspopup</code> is most relevant to use when there is a visual indicator in the element that triggers the popup. For example, many controls styled with a downward pointing
              triangle, chevron, or ellipsis (three consecutive dots) have become standard visual indicators that a popup will display when the control is activated. If some functional difference is
              relevant to display to a sighted user by means of a different visual style, that functional difference is usually relevant to convey to users of assistive technology. If there is no
              visual indication that an element will trigger a popup, authors are advised to consider whether use of <code>aria-haspopup</code> is necessary, and avoid using it when it's not.
            </p>
            <p class="note">This property is being deprecated as a global property in ARIA 1.2. In future versions it will only be allowed on roles where it is specifically supported.</p>

            <p><a>Indicates</a>, when set to <code>true</code>, that an <a>element</a> and its entire subtree are hidden from assistive technology, regardless of whether it is visibly rendered.</p>
            <p>
              User agents determine an element's [=element/hidden=] status based on whether it is rendered, and the rendering is usually controlled by CSS. For example, an element whose
              <code>display</code> property is set to <code>none</code> is not rendered. An element is considered [=element/hidden=] if it, or any of its ancestors are not rendered or have their
              <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute value set to <code>true</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MUST NOT use <code>aria-hidden</code> to hide the root element or the host language element that <a data-cite="html/dom.html#represents">represents</a> the contents of the
              primary document in view. For instance, the <code>html</code> or <code>body</code> elements in an HTML document. Authors MAY, with caution, use <code>aria-hidden</code> to hide visibly
              rendered content from assistive technologies <em>only</em> if the act of hiding this content is intended to improve the experience for users of assistive technologies by removing
              redundant or extraneous content. Authors using <code>aria-hidden</code> to hide visible content from screen readers MUST ensure that identical or equivalent meaning and functionality is
              exposed to assistive technologies.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              Authors are advised to use extreme caution and consider a wide range of disabilities when hiding visibly rendered content from assistive technologies. For example, a sighted,
              dexterity-impaired individual might use voice-controlled assistive technologies to access a visual interface. If an author hides visible link text "Go to checkout" and exposes similar,
              yet non-identical link text "Check out now" to the accessibility API, the user might be unable to access the interface they perceive using voice control software. Similar problems can
              also arise for screen reader users. For example, a sighted telephone support technician might attempt to have the blind screen reader user click the "Go to checkout" link, which they
              might be unable to find using a type-ahead item search ("Go to…"), since that text would have been hidden by the use of the attribute.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              As of ARIA 1.3, <code><sref>aria-hidden</sref>="false"</code> is now synonymous with <code>aria-hidden="undefined"</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              The original intent for <code>aria-hidden="false"</code> was to allow user agents to expose content that was otherwise hidden from the accessibility tree. However, due to ambiguity in
              the specification and inconsistent browser support for the <code>false</code> value, the original intent is no longer supported.
            </p>
            <p>
              To prevent authors erroneously hiding entire window-rendered documents only to those using assistive technology, user agents MUST NOT expose the hidden state to assistive technologies if
              it is specified on the root element or the host language element that <a data-cite="html/dom.html#represents">represents</a> the contents of the primary document in view. For instance,
              the <code>html</code> or <code>body</code> elements in an HTML document, or the root <code>svg</code> element if it is rendered as its own primary document in the browser window. If
              authors were to specify <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> on the opening tag for an embedded document, for instance on a <code>math</code> or <code>svg</code> embedded within an HTML
              document, user agents would still be expected to hide these elements from assistive technologies.

            <p><a>Defines</a> keyboard shortcuts that an author has implemented to activate or give focus to an element.</p>
            <p>
              The value of the <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code> attribute is a space-separated list of keyboard shortcuts that can be pressed to activate a command or textbox widget. The keys defined in
              the shortcuts represent the physical keys pressed and not the actual characters generated. Each keyboard shortcut consists of one or more tokens delimited by the plus sign ("+")
              representing zero or more modifier keys and exactly one non-modifier key that must be pressed simultaneously to activate the given shortcut.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MUST specify modifier keys exactly according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/">UI Events KeyboardEvent key Values</a> spec [[!uievents-key]] - for example,
              "Alt", "Control", "Shift", "Meta", or "AltGraph". Note that Meta corresponds to the Command key, and Alt to the Option key, on Apple computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The valid names for non-modifier keys are any printable character such as "A", "B", "1", "2", "$", "Plus" for a plus sign, "Space" for the spacebar, or the names of any other
              non-modifier key specified in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/">UI Events KeyboardEvent key Values</a> spec [[!uievents-key]] - for example, "Enter", "Tab", "ArrowRight",
              "PageDown", "Escape", or "F1". The use of "Space" for the spacebar is an exception to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/">UI Events KeyboardEvent key Values</a> spec
              [[!uievents-key]] as the space or spacebar key is encoded as <code>'&#160;'</code> and would be treated as a whitespace character.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MUST ensure modifier keys come first when they are part of a keyboard shortcut. Authors MUST ensure that required non-modifier keys come last when they are part of a shortcut.
              The order of the modifier keys is not otherwise significant, so "Alt+Shift+T" and "Shift+Alt+T" are equivalent, but "T+Shift+Alt" is not valid because all of the modifier keys don't come
              first, and "Alt" is not valid because it doesn't include at least one non-modifier key.
            </p>
            <p>When specifying an alphabetic key, both the uppercase and lowercase variants are considered equivalent: "a" and "A" are the same.</p>
            <p>
              When implementing keyboard shortcuts authors should consider the keyboards they intend to support to avoid unintended results. Keyboard designs vary significantly based on the device
              used and the languages supported. For example, many modifier keys are used in conjunction with other keys to create common punctuation symbols, create number characters, swap keyboard
              sides on bilingual keyboards to switch languages, and perform a number of other functions.
            </p>
            <p>
              For many supported keyboards, authors can prevent conflicts by avoiding keys other than ASCII letters, as number characters and common punctuation often require modifiers. Here, the
              keyboard shortcut entered does not equate to the key generated. For example, in French keyboard layouts, the number characters are not available until you press the Control key, so a
              keyboard shortcut defined as "Control+2" would be ambiguous as this is how one would type the "2" character on a French keyboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the character used is determined by a modifier key, the author MUST specify the actual key used to generate the character, that is generated by the key, and not the resulting
              character. This convention enables the assistive technology to accurately convey what keys must be used to generate the shortcut. For example, on most U.S. English keyboards, the percent
              sign "%" can be input by pressing Shift+5. The correct way to specify this shortcut is "Shift+5". It is incorrect to specify "%" or "Shift+%". However, note that on some international
              keyboards the percent sign might be an unmodified key, in which case "%" and "Shift+%" could be correct on those keyboards.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the key that needs to be specified is illegal in the host language or would cause a string to be terminated, authors MUST use the string escaping sequence of the host language to
              specify it. For example, the single-quote character can be encoded as "&amp;#39;" in HTML.
            </p>
            <p>Examples of valid keyboard shortcuts include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"A"</li>
              <li>"Shift+Space"</li>
              <li>"Control+Alt+."</li>
              <li>"Control+Shift+&amp;#39;"</li>
              <li>"Alt+Shift+P Control+F"</li>
              <li>"Meta+C Meta+Shift+C"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              User agents MUST NOT change keyboard behavior in response to the <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code> attribute. Authors MUST handle scripted keyboard events to process
              <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code>. The <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code> attribute exposes the existence of these shortcuts so that assistive technologies can communicate this information to
              users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD provide a way to expose keyboard shortcuts so that all users can discover them, such as through the use of a tooltip. Authors MUST ensure that
              <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code> applied to disabled elements are unavailable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD avoid implementing shortcut keys that inhibit operating system, user agent, or assistive technology functionality. This requires the author to carefully consider both
              which keys to assign and the contexts and conditions in which the keys are available to the user. For guidance, see the keyboard shortcuts section of the
              <cite
                ><a href="" class="practices"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices Guide</a></cite
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD consider whether the keyboard shortcut will be valid in each language and physical keyboard layout, and consider localizing the shortcut in languages, locales, and common
              hardware keyboard configurations.

            <p><a>Defines</a> the hierarchical level of an <a>element</a> within a structure.</p>
            <p>
              This can be applied inside trees to tree items, to headings inside a document, to nested grids, nested tablists and to other structural items that might appear inside a container or
              participate in an ownership hierarchy. The value for <pref>aria-level</pref> is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
            </p>
            <p>
              Levels increase with depth. If the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> ancestry does not accurately represent the level, authors SHOULD explicitly define the
              <pref>aria-level</pref> <a>attribute</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This attribute is applied to elements that act as leaf nodes within the orientation of the set, for example, on elements with role <rref>treeitem</rref> rather than elements with role
              <rref>group</rref>. This means that multiple elements in a set can have the same value for this attribute. Although it would be less repetitive to provide a single value on the
              container, restricting this to leaf nodes ensures that there is a single way for <a>assistive technologies</a> to use the attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> ancestry accurately represents the level, the <a>user agent</a> can calculate the level of an item from the document structure. This
              attribute can be used to provide an explicit indication of the level when that is not possible to calculate from the document structure or the <pref>aria-owns</pref> attribute. User
              agent support for automatic calculation of level might vary; authors SHOULD test with [=user agents=] and assistive technologies to determine whether this attribute is needed. If the
              author intends for the user agent to calculate the level, the author SHOULD omit this attribute.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              In the case of a <rref>treegrid</rref>, <pref>aria-level</pref> is supported on elements with the role <rref>row</rref>, not elements with role <rref>gridcell</rref>. At first glance,
              this might seem inconsistent with the application of <pref>aria-level</pref> on <rref>treeitem</rref> elements, but it is consistent in that the <rref>row</rref> acts as the leaf node
              within the vertical orientation of the <rref>grid</rref>, whereas the <rref>gridcell</rref> is a leaf node within the horizontal orientation of each <rref>row</rref>. Level is not
              supported on sets of cells within rows, so the <pref>aria-level</pref> attribute is applied to the element with the role <rref>row</rref>.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              On elements with role <pref>heading</pref>, values for <pref>aria-level</pref> above 6 can create difficulties for users. Also, at the time of this writing, most combinations of user
              agents and assistive technologies only support <pref>aria-level</pref> integers 1-9 on headings.

          <div class="property-description">
            <p>
              <a>Indicates</a> that an <a>element</a> will be updated, and describes the types of updates the [=user agents=], <a>assistive technologies</a>, and user can expect from the
              <a>live region</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <span>values</span> of this <a>attribute</a> are expressed in degrees of importance. When regions are specified as <code>polite</code>, assistive technologies will notify users of
              updates but generally do not interrupt the current task, and updates take low priority. When regions are specified as <code>assertive</code>, assistive technologies will immediately
              notify the user, and could potentially clear the speech queue of previous updates.
            </p>
            <p>
              Politeness levels are essentially an ordering mechanism for updates and serve as a strong suggestion to user agents or assistive technologies. The value can be overridden by user agents,
              assistive technologies, or the user. For example, if assistive technologies can determine that a change occurred in response to a key press or a mouse click, the assistive technologies
              might present that change immediately even if the value of the <pref>aria-live</pref> attribute states otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since different users have different needs, it is up to the user to tweak his or her assistive technologies' response to a live region with a certain politeness level from the commonly
              defined baseline. Assistive technologies might choose to implement increasing and decreasing levels of granularity so that the user can exercise control over queues and interruptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the [=ARIA/property=] is not set on an <a>object</a> that needs to send updates, the politeness level is the value of the nearest ancestor that sets the
              <pref>aria-live</pref> attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <pref>aria-live</pref> attribute is the primary determination for the order of presentation of changes to live regions. Implementations will also consider the default level of
              politeness in a <a>role</a> when the <pref>aria-live</pref> attribute is not set in the ancestor chain (e.g., <rref>log</rref> changes are <code>polite</code> by default). Items which
              are <code>assertive</code> will be presented immediately, followed by <code>polite</code> items. User agents or assistive technologies can choose to clear queued changes when an
              assertive change occurs. (e.g., changes in an assertive region can remove all currently queued changes)
            </p>
            <p>
              When live regions are marked as <code>polite</code>, assistive technologies SHOULD announce updates at the next graceful opportunity, such as at the end of speaking the current sentence
              or when the user pauses typing. When live regions are marked as <code>assertive</code>, assistive technologies SHOULD notify the user immediately. Because an interruption might disorient
              users or cause them to not complete their current task, authors SHOULD NOT use the assertive value unless the interruption is imperative.

            <p><a>Indicates</a> whether an <a>element</a> is modal when displayed.</p>
            <p>
              The <pref>aria-modal</pref> <a>attribute</a> is used to indicate that the presence of a "modal" element precludes usage of other content on the page. For example, when a modal dialog is
              displayed, it is expected that the user's interaction is limited to the contents of the dialog, until the modal dialog loses focus or is no longer displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a modal element is displayed, assistive technologies SHOULD navigate to the element unless focus has explicitly been set elsewhere. Some assistive technologies limit navigation to
              the modal element's contents. If focus moves to an element outside the modal element, assistive technologies SHOULD NOT limit navigation to the modal element.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a modal element is displayed, authors MUST ensure the interface can be controlled using only descendants of the modal element. In other words, if a modal dialog has a close button,
              the button should be a descendant of the dialog. When a modal element is displayed, authors SHOULD mark all other contents as inert (such as "inert subtrees" in HTML) if the ability to
              do so exists in the host language.

              <a>Identifies</a> an <a>element</a> (or elements) in order to define a visual, functional, or contextual parent/child <a>relationship</a> between

            <p>
              The value of the <pref>aria-owns</pref> <a>attribute</a> is a space-separated ID reference list that references one or more elements in the document by ID. The reason for adding
              <pref>aria-owns</pref> is to expose a parent/child contextual relationship to <a>assistive technologies</a> that is otherwise impossible to infer from the
              <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If an element has both <pref>aria-owns</pref> and <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> children then the order of the child elements with respect to the parent/child
              relationship is the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> children first, then the elements referenced in <pref>aria-owns</pref>. If the author intends that the
              <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> children are not first, then list the DOM children in <pref>aria-owns</pref> in the desired order. Authors SHOULD NOT use
              <pref>aria-owns</pref> as a replacement for the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> hierarchy. If the relationship is represented in the DOM, do not use
              <pref>aria-owns</pref>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Authors MUST ensure that an element's ID is not specified in more than one other element's <pref>aria-owns</pref> attribute at any time. In other words, an element can have only one
              explicit owner. Authors MUST NOT create circular references with <pref>aria-owns</pref>. In the case of authoring error with <pref>aria-owns</pref>, the user agent MAY ignore some
              <pref>aria-owns</pref> element references in order to build a consistent model of the content.

              Authors SHOULD NOT use <pref>aria-placeholder</pref> instead of a label as their purposes are different: The label indicates what kind of information is expected. The placeholder text is

            </p>
            <p>
              Authors SHOULD present this hint to the user by displaying the hint text at any time the control's <span>value</span> is the empty string. This includes cases where the control first

            <p class="note">
              As is the case with the related <code>[^input/placeholder^]</code> attribute in HTML, use of placeholder text as a replacement for a displayed label can reduce the accessibility and
              usability of the control for a range of users including older users and users with cognitive, mobility, fine motor skill or vision impairments. While the hint given by the control's
              label is shown at all times, the short hint given in the placeholder attribute is only shown before the user enters a value. Furthermore, placeholder text might be mistaken for a
              pre-filled value, and as commonly implemented the default color of the placeholder text provides insufficient contrast and the lack of a separate visible label reduces the size of the
              hit region available for setting focus on the control.
            </p>

              Toggle buttons require a full press-and-release cycle to change their value. Activating it once changes the value to <code>true</code>, and activating it another time changes the value

          <div class="property-description">
            <p><a>Indicates</a> what notifications the user agent will trigger when the <a>accessibility tree</a> within a live region is modified. See related <pref>aria-atomic</pref>.</p>
            <p>
              The <a>attribute</a> is represented as a space-separated list of the following <span>values</span>: <code>additions</code>, <code>removals</code>, <code>text</code>; or a single
              catch-all value <code>all</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is used to describe <a>semantically</a> meaningful changes, as opposed to merely presentational ones. For example, nodes that are removed from the top of a log are merely removed
              for purposes of creating room for other entries, and the removal of them does not have meaning. However, in the case of a buddy list, removal of a buddy name indicates that they are no
              longer online, and this is a meaningful <a>event</a>. In that case <pref>aria-relevant</pref> will be set to <code>all</code>. When the <pref>aria-relevant</pref> attribute is not
              provided, the default value, <code>additions text</code>, indicates that text modifications and node additions are relevant, but that node removals are irrelevant.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              <pref>aria-relevant</pref> values of removals or all are to be used sparingly. Assistive technologies only need to be informed of content removal when its removal represents an important
              change, such as a buddy leaving a chat room.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              Text removals should only be considered relevant if one of the specified values is 'removals' or 'all'. For example, for a text change from 'foo' to 'bar' in a live region with a default
              <pref>aria-relevant</pref> value, the text addition ('bar') would be spoken, but the text removal ('foo') would not.
            </p>
            <p>
              <pref>aria-relevant</pref> is an optional attribute of live regions. This is a suggestion to <a>assistive technologies</a>, but assistive technologies are not required to present changes
              of all the relevant types.
            </p>
            <p>
              When <pref>aria-relevant</pref> is not defined, an element's value is inherited from the nearest ancestor with a defined value. Although the value is a
              <a href="#valuetype_token_list">token list</a>, inherited values are not additive; the value provided on a descendant element completely overrides any inherited value from an ancestor
              element.
            </p>
            <p>
              When text changes are denoted as relevant, user agents MUST monitor any descendant node change that affects the
              <cite><a href="" class="accname">Accessible Name and Description Computation</a></cite> [[ACCNAME-1.2]] of the live region as if the accessible name were determined from contents (<a
                href="#namecalculation"
                >nameFrom: contents</a
              >). For example, a text change would be triggered if the HTML <code>alt</code> attribute of a contained image changed. However, no change would be triggered if there was a text change to
              a node outside the live region, even if that node was referenced (via <pref>aria-labelledby</pref>) by an element contained in the live region.

            <p><a>Defines</a> a human-readable, author-localized description for the <a>role</a> of an <a>element</a>.</p>
            <p>
              Some <a>assistive technologies</a>, such as screen readers, present the role of an element as part of the user experience. Such assistive technologies typically localize the name of the
              role, and they might customize it as well. Users of these assistive technologies depend on the presentation of the role name, such as "region," "button," or "slider," for an
              understanding of the purpose of the element and, if it is a widget, how to interact with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <code>aria-roledescription</code> property gives authors the ability to override how assistive technologies localize and express the name of a role. Thus inappropriately using
              <code>aria-roledescription</code> might inhibit users' ability to understand or interact with an element. Authors SHOULD limit use of <code>aria-roledescription</code> to clarifying the
              purpose of non-interactive container roles like <rref>group</rref> or <rref>region</rref>, or to providing a <em>more specific</em> description of a <rref>widget</rref>.
            </p>
            <p>When using <code>aria-roledescription</code>, authors SHOULD also ensure that:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The element to which <code>aria-roledescription</code> is applied has a valid <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role or has an implicit WAI-ARIA role
                semantic.
              </li>
              <li>The value of <code>aria-roledescription</code> is not empty or does not contain only [=ascii whitespace|whitespace=] characters.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note">
              Depending on the assistive technology, user verbosity settings, or other factors, certain elements' role descriptions might not be conveyed. If specifying
              <code>aria-roledescription</code> on such elements, then the custom role descriptions might also not be conveyed by these assistive technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, authors MUST NOT specify <code>aria-roledescription</code> on an element which has an explicit or implicit WAI-ARIA role where <code>aria-roledescription</code> is
              <a href="#prohibitedattributes">prohibited</a>.
            </p>
            <p>User agents MUST NOT expose the <code>aria-roledescription</code> property if any of the following conditions exist:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The element to which <code>aria-roledescription</code> is applied has an explicit or implicit WAI-ARIA role where <code>aria-roledescription</code> is
                <a href="#prohibitedattributes">prohibited</a>.
              </li>
              <li>The value of <code>aria-roledescription</code> is undefined or the empty string.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <a>Assistive technologies</a> SHOULD use the value of <code>aria-roledescription</code> when presenting the role of an element, but SHOULD NOT change other functionality based on the
              role of an element that has a value for <code>aria-roledescription</code>. For example, an assistive technology that provides functions for navigating to the next <rref>region</rref> or
              <rref>button</rref> SHOULD allow those functions to navigate to regions and buttons that have an <code>aria-roledescription</code>.
            </p>
            <p>The following two examples show the use of <code>aria-roledescription</code> to indicate that a non-interactive container is a "slide" in a web-based presentation application.</p>
            <pre class="example highlight html">
&lt;div role="article" aria-roledescription="slide" id="slide" aria-labelledby="slideheading"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="slideheading">Quarterly Report&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;!-- remaining slide contents --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre
            >
            <pre class="example highlight html">
&lt;article aria-roledescription="slide" id="slide" aria-labelledby="slideheading"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="slideheading">Quarterly Report&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;!-- remaining slide contents --&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;</pre
            >
            <p>In the previous examples, a screen reader user might hear "Quarterly Report, slide" rather than the more vague "Quarterly Report, article" or "Quarterly Report, group."</p>

              This [=ARIA/property=] is marked on the members of a set, not the container element that collects the members of the set. To orient the user by saying an element is "item X out of Y,"

              If all items up to the current item in a set are present in the document structure, it is not necessary to set this <a>attribute</a>, as the <a>user agent</a> can automatically calculate
              the position for these items. However, if all previous items in the set are not present in the document structure at a given moment, the author MUST set this <a>attribute</a>to provide
              an explicit indication of an element's position.
            </p>
            <p>
              When specifying <code>aria-setsize</code>, authors MUST set the value to an integer equal to the number of items in the set. If the total number of items is unknown, authors SHOULD set
              the value of <code>aria-setsize</code> to <code>-1</code>.
            </p>

              When specifying <code>aria-setsize</code> on a <rref>menuitem</rref>, <rref>menuitemcheckbox</rref>, or <rref>menuitemradio</rref>, authors SHOULD set the value of
              <code>aria-setsize</code> based on the total number of items in the <rref>menu</rref>, excluding any separators.

            <p>This property is used, for example, on a range widget such as a slider or progress bar.</p>
            <p>
              If the current value is not known (for example, an indeterminate progress bar), the author SHOULD NOT set the <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> <a>attribute</a>. If the
              <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> attribute is absent, no information is implied about the current value. If the <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> has a known maximum and minimum, the author SHOULD
              provide properties for <pref>aria-valuemax</pref> and <pref>aria-valuemin</pref>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The value of <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> is a decimal number. If the range is a set of numeric values, then <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> is one of those values. For example, if the range is
              [0, 1], a valid <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> is 0.5. A value outside the range, such as -2.5 or 1.1, is invalid.
            </p>
            <p>
              For <rref>progressbar</rref> elements and <rref>scrollbar</rref> elements, assistive technologies SHOULD render the value to users as a percent, calculated as a position on the range
              from <pref>aria-valuemin</pref> to <pref>aria-valuemax</pref> if both are defined, otherwise the actual value with a percent indicator. For elements with role <rref>slider</rref> and
              <rref>spinbutton</rref>, assistive technologies SHOULD render the actual value to users.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the rendered value cannot be accurately represented as a number, authors SHOULD use the <pref>aria-valuetext</pref> attribute in conjunction with <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> to
              provide a user-friendly representation of the range's current value. For example, a slider might have rendered values of <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>, and <code>large</code>.
              In this case, the values of <pref>aria-valuetext</pref> would be one of the strings: <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>, or <code>large</code>.
            </p>
            <p class="note">If <pref>aria-valuetext</pref> is specified, assistive technologies render that instead of the value of <pref>aria-valuenow</pref>.</p>

      <h1>Implementation in Host Languages</h1>
      <p>
        The <a>roles</a>, <a>state</a>, and [=ARIA/properties=] defined in this specification do not form a complete web language or format. They are intended to be used in the context of a host
        language. This section discusses how host languages are to implement <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, to ensure that the markup specified here will
        integrate smoothly and effectively with the host language markup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although markup languages look alike superficially, they do not share language definition infrastructure. To accommodate differences in language-building approaches, the requirements are both
        general and modularization-specific. While allowing for differences in how the specifications are written, the intent is to maintain consistency in how the
        <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> information looks to authors and how it is manipulated in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> by scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles, states, and properties are implemented as [=attributes=] of [=elements=]. Roles are applied by placing their names
        among the tokens appearing in the value of a host-language-provided <code>role</code> attribute. States and properties each get their own attribute, with values as defined for each particular
        state or property in this specification. The name of the attribute is the aria-prefixed name of the state or property.
      </p>
      <section id="host_general_role">
        <h2>Role Attribute</h2>
        <p>
          An implementing host language will provide a <code><a>role</a></code> <a>attribute</a> with the following characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The attribute value MUST allow a [=token list=] as the value;</li>
          <li>
            The appearance of the name literal of any concrete <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a>role</a> as one of these tokens MUST NOT in and of itself make the
            attribute value illegal in the host-language syntax; and
          </li>
          <li>
            The first name literal of a non-abstract <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role in the list of tokens in the role attribute defines the role according to
            which the user agent MUST process the element. User Agent processing for roles is defined in the
            <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite> [[CORE-AAM-1.2]].

        <h3>State and Property Attributes</h3>
        <p>An implementing host language MUST allow [=attributes=] with the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The attribute name is the name of any state or property identified in the <a href="#states_and_properties">Supported States and Properties</a> section, such as <sref>aria-busy</sref>,
            <sref>aria-selected</sref>, <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>, <pref>aria-valuetext</pref>;
          </li>
          <li>The syntax does <strong>NOT</strong> prevent the attribute from appearing anywhere that it is applicable, as specified in this specification;</li>
          <li>When these attributes appear in a document instance, the attributes will be processed as defined in this specification.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Host languages that support <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names-20060816/">XML Namespaces</a></cite> [[XML-NAMES]] <strong>MAY</strong> require that
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attributes be used with a namespace. In this case, the namespace for
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> state and property attributes <strong>MUST</strong> be <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/wai-aria/</code>. To use
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> in host languages that do not explicitly describe support for it, authors <strong>SHOULD</strong> use this namespace as
          well, if the host language supports namespaces and there is expectation that user agents will recognize the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> namespace. The
          namespace prefix is not defined by this specification but generally is expected to be &quot;<code>aria</code>&quot;.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> state and property attributes have a naming convention such that they all begin with the string
          &quot;<code>aria-</code>&quot;. This is <em>not</em> a namespace prefix, it is a part of the state or property name. Therefore, when using
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties with namespace prefixes, the complete attribute name will be like
          &quot;<code>aria:aria-foo</code>&quot;.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some host languages do not use namespaces with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> state and property attributes, either because the host language does not
          support namespaces or because the designers wish to incorporate <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> into the core feature set. In these host languages, the
          namespace name for these attributes has no value. The names of these attributes do not have a prefix offset by a colon; in the terms of namespaces they are unprefixed attribute names. The
          ECMAScript binding of the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> interface <code>getAttributeNS</code> for example, treats the empty string (<code>&quot;&quot;</code>) as
          representing this condition, so that both <code>getAttribute(&quot;aria-busy&quot;)</code> and <code>getAttributeNS(&quot;&quot;, &quot;aria-busy&quot;)</code> access the same
          <sref>aria-busy</sref> attribute in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          According to the requirements of this section, some user agents recognize <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> state and property attributes
          <em>with</em> namespaces, some <em>without</em> namespaces, and some might recognize both. Authors are advised to be aware of which form is supported for the host language they are using.
          Unless the host language and supporting user agents explicitly indicate that the namespace is required, authors are advised to use the attribute without namespaces. Even user agents that
          support namespaces generally do not publish namespaced <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties to accessibility APIs. In particular, current
          implementations of HTML, including XHTML, do not support this namespace.

        <h2>Focus Navigation</h2>

          An implementing host language MUST provide support for the author to make all interactive elements focusable, that is, any renderable or event-receiving elements. An implementing host

          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is designed to provide <a>semantic</a> information about objects when host languages lack native semantics for the object.
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is designed, however, to provide additional semantics for many host languages. Furthermore, host languages over time can
          evolve and provide new native features that correspond to WAI-ARIA features. Therefore, there are many situations in which
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics are redundant with host language semantics.
        </p>
        <p>
          These host language features can be viewed as having &quot;implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics&quot;. User agent processing of features
          with implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics would be similar to the processing for the
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature. The processing might not be identical because of lexical differences between the host language feature and the
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature, but generally the user agent would expose the same information to the accessibility API. Features with implicit
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics satisfy <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> structural requirements such as
          Required Accessibility Parent Roles, Allowed Accessibility Child Roles, required states and properties, etc. and do not require explicit
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics to be provided. On elements with implicit WAI-ARIA roles, authors can also use WAI-ARIA states and properties
          supported by those roles <em>without</em> requiring explicit indication of the WAI-ARIA role.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if an element with the functionality already exists, such as a checkbox or radio button, use the native semantics of the host language.
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup is only intended to be used to enhance the native semantics (e.g., indicating that the element is required with
          <pref>aria-required</pref>), or to change the semantics to a different purpose from the standard functionality of the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics affect the conflict resolution procedures in the following section, Conflicts with Host Language
          Semantics. Therefore, implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics need to be defined in a normative specification, such as the host language
          specification or the <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite

        <h2>Conflicts with Host Language Semantics</h2>
        <p>
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles, states, and properties are intended to add <a>semantic</a> information when native host language elements with
          these semantics are not available, and are generally used on elements that have no native semantics of their own. They can also be used on elements that have similar but non-identical
          semantics (for example, a nested list could be used to represent a tree structure). This method can be part of a fallback strategy for older browsers that have no
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> implementation, or because native presentation of the repurposed element reduces the amount of style and/or script needed.
          Except for the cases outlined below, user agents MUST always use the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics to define how it exposes the element to
          accessibility APIs, rather than using the host language semantics.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to these normal situations in which <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is expected to override native semantics, there are elements that are
          inappropriate to override with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. This could be because identical host language semantics exist, so
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is not needed, or because semantics from <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> directly
          conflict with host language semantics. When a feature in the host language with identical role semantics and values is available, and the author has no compelling reason to avoid using the
          host language feature, authors SHOULD use the host language features rather than repurpose other elements with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Host languages can have features that have implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics corresponding to roles. When a
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role is provided, user agents MUST use the semantic of the
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role for processing, not the native semantic, unless the role requires
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties whose attributes are explicitly forbidden on the native element by the host language. Values for
          roles do not conflict in the same way as values for states and properties (for example, the HTML 'checked' attribute and the 'aria-checked' attribute could have conflicting values), and
          authors are expected to have valid reason to provide a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role even on elements that would not normally be repurposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties correspond to host language features that have the same
          <a href="#implicit_semantics">implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantic</a>, it can be particularly problematic to use the
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature. If the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature and the host language feature
          are both provided but their values are not kept in sync, user agents and assistive technologies cannot know which value to use. Therefore, to prevent providing conflicting states and
          properties to assistive technologies, host languages MUST explicitly declare where the use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attributes on each host
          language element conflicts with native features for that element. When a host language declares a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attribute to be in
          direct semantic conflict with a native feature for a given element, user agents MUST ignore the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attribute and instead use
          the host language feature with the same implicit semantic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Host languages MAY document features that cannot be overridden with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> (these are called "strong native semantics"). These
          can be features that have implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics, as well as features where the processing would be uncertain if the semantics
          were changed with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. Conformance checkers MAY signal an error or warning when a
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role is used on elements with strong native semantics, but as described above, user agents MUST still use the value of the
          semantic of the WAI-ARIA role when exposing the element to accessibility APIs unless the native host language semantic is permanently presentational.
        </p>
        <p>
          The opportunity for host languages to create exceptions to the WAI-ARIA override of native features is meant to avoid potential author errors or problems with intrinsic processing of host
          language features. Author errors could happen when a host language and WAI-ARIA provide similar but not identical features, where it might not be clear how changing one but not the other
          affects the accessibility API. Intrinsic processing refers to the way a feature is processed, beyond simple rendering and exposure to the Accessibility API, that cannot reasonably be changed
          in response to an ARIA feature, and would lead to unpredictable results were ARIA allowed. In these situations, there is good reason for host languages to limit the scope of WAI-ARIA.
          However, this provision does not give blanket permission for host languages to forbid the use of WAI-ARIA simply by documenting, feature by feature, that it cannot be used. Host languages
          should create restrictions on the use of ARIA only when it is critical to effective processing of content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain ARIA features are critical to building a complete model in the accessibility API. Such features are not expected to conflict with native host language semantics (though they can
          complement them). Therefore, host languages MUST NOT declare strong native semantics that prevent use of the following ARIA features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><pref>aria-describedby</pref></li>
          <li><pref>aria-description</pref></li>
          <li><pref>aria-label</pref></li>
          <li><pref>aria-labelledby</pref></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>State and Property Attribute Processing</h2>
        <p>
          State and property attributes are included in host languages, and therefore syntax for representation of their value types is governed by the host language. For each of the value types
          defined in <a href="#propcharacteristic_value">Value</a>, an appropriate value type from the host language is used. Recommended correspondences between
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> value types and various host language value types are listed in
          <a href="#typemapping">Mapping <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Value types to languages</a>. This is a non-normative mapping in order to accommodate new
          host languages supporting <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The list value types&#8212;ID reference list and token list&#8212;allow more than one value of the given type to be provided. The values are separated by delimiter characters recognized by
          the host language for list attributes, such as space characters, commas, etc. Some languages might require a specific, single delimiter, while others might allow various delimiters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Global states and properties are supported on any element in the host language. However, authors MUST only use non-global states and properties on elements with a role supporting the state
          or property; either defined as an explicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role, or as defined by the host language implicit WAI-ARIA semantic matching an
          appropriate WAI-ARIA role. When a role attribute is added to an element, the <a>semantics</a> and behavior of the element, including support for
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties, are augmented or overridden by the role behavior. User agents <strong>MUST</strong> ignore
          non-global states and properties used on an element without a role supporting the state or property; either defined as an explicit WAI-ARIA role, or as defined by the host language WAI-ARIA
          semantic matching an appropriate <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role. For example, the <pref>aria-valuetext</pref> attribute can be used on a
          <rref>progressbar</rref>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles have associated states and properties that are qualified as "supported" or "required". An example of a property
          <em>supported</em> by the <a class="role-reference" href="#combobox">combobox</a> role is <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-autocomplete">aria-autocomplete</a>. The property is
          designated "supported" in this case because a given <code>combobox</code> might or might not implement auto completion. In contrast, the <code>combobox</code> role <em>requires</em> the
          <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-expanded">aria-expanded</a> state in order to indicate that it is expandable. Comboboxes have a controlled popup element, such as a
          <code>listbox</code>, that is either open or closed. If the <code>listbox</code> is open, the <code>combobox</code> is in its expanded state; otherwise it is collapsed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles are used, <em>supported</em> states and properties that are not present in the DOM are treated according to
          their default value. Keeping with the <code>combobox</code> example, a missing <code>aria-autocomplete</code> attribute is equivalent to <code>aria-autocomplete=&quot;none&quot;</code>,
          meaning the <code>combobox</code> does not offer auto completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, <em>required</em> states and properties that are absent are an author error. Missing required states and properties are processed as detailed at
          <a href="#document-handling_author-errors">Handling Author Errors</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elements that have implicit WAI-ARIA semantics support the full set of WAI-ARIA states and properties supported by the corresponding role. Therefore, authors MAY omit the role when setting
          states and properties. The role is only needed when the implicit WAI-ARIA role of the element needs to be changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes states and properties are present in the DOM but have a zero-length string ("") as their value. Authors MAY specify a zero-length string ("") for any supported (but not required)
          state or property. User agents SHOULD treat state and property attributes with a value of "" the same as they treat an absent attribute. For supported states and properties, this corresponds
          to the default value, but if it is a required attribute, it signals an author error and is processed as detailed at <a href="#document-handling_author-errors">Handling Author Errors</a>.

          As stated in the <a href="#role_definitions">Definition of Roles</a> section, it is considered an authoring error to use <a href="#abstract_roles">abstract roles</a> in content. User agents

          the element as if no <a>role</a> had been provided. For example, <code>&lt;table&nbsp;role=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;</code> should be exposed in the same way as <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> and

        <h3>Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution</h3>
        <p>There are a number of ways presentational role conflicts are resolved.</p>
        <p>User agents MUST NOT expose [=elements=] having explicit or inherited presentational role in the accessibility tree, with these exceptions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If an element is focusable, user agents MUST ignore the <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> role and expose the element with its implicit role, in order to ensure that the element
            is <a>operable</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an <a href="#mustContain">allowed child element</a> has an explicit non-presentational role, user agents MUST ignore an inherited presentational role and expose the element with its
            explicit role. If the action of exposing the explicit role causes the accessibility tree to be malformed, the expected results are undefined.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an element has <a>global</a> WAI-ARIA states or properties, user agents MUST ignore the <rref>none</rref>/<rref>presentation</rref> role and instead expose the element's implicit role.
            However, if an element has only non-global, role-specific WAI-ARIA states or properties, the element MUST NOT be exposed unless the presentational role is inherited and an explicit
            non-presentational role is applied.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          Some <a>global</a> WAI-ARIA states and properties are <a>prohibited</a> on certain roles. These states and properties are still considered global for the purposes of Presentational Role
          Conflict resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, <pref>aria-describedby</pref> is a global attribute and would always be applied; <pref>aria-level</pref> is not a global attribute and would therefore only apply if the element
          was not in a presentational state.
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight html">
<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 1. [role="none"] is ignored due to the global aria-describedby property. --&gt;</span>
&lt;h1 role="none" aria-describedby="comment-1"&gt; Sample Content &lt;/h1&gt;
<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 2. [role="none"] negates both the implicit 'heading' and the non-global aria-level. --&gt;</span>
&lt;h1 role="none" aria-level="2"&gt; Sample Content &lt;/h1&gt;
		</pre>
        <p>Authors MUST NOT use <rref>presentation</rref> and <rref>none</rref> on elements where user agents will ignore that role because it conflicts with one of the above items.</p>

          <h3>Disambiguation Pattern</h3>
          <p>Though specification authors can make exceptions to this pattern, the following rules were used to disambiguate names and case of the IDL attributes listed above.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Any attribute name referencing concepts that are combinations of two or more words (such as "value text") becomes a camel-cased IDL attribute capitalizing each word boundary. For
              example, <pref>aria-valuetext</pref> becomes <code>ariaValueText</code> with both the V and T capitalized.
            </li>
            <li>
              Likewise, any attribute name referencing concepts that can be hyphenated (such as "multi-selectable") becomes a camel-cased IDL attribute capitalizing each hyphenation boundary. For
              example, the only valid spelling for "multi-selectable" is hyphenated, so <pref>aria-multiselectable</pref> becomes <code>ariaMultiSelectable</code> with both the M and S capitalized.

            <li>
              When trusted dictionary sources list both hyphenated or non-hyphenated spellings (e.g., "multi-line" and "multiline" are both valid spellings) use the hyphenated version and apply the
              hyphenation rule above. For example, <pref>aria-multiline</pref> becomes <code>ariaMultiLine</code> with both the M and L capitalized.
            </li>
            <li>
              If all trusted dictionary sources list a single spelling of a compound word with no spaces or hyphens, only the first letter of the term is capitalized. For example, neither
              “place-holder” nor “place holder” are considered valid spellings of the term “placeholder,” so <pref>aria-placeholder</pref> becomes <code>ariaPlaceholder</code> with only the P
              capitalized.
            </li>
            <li>There are currently no acronym-based ARIA attributes, but if future attributes include acronym usage, attempt to match existing DOM conventions (e.g., ID becomes Id).</li>

        <h2>Example IDL Attribute Usage</h2>
        <p>The primary purpose of ARIA IDL attribute reflection is to ease JavaScript-based manipulation of values. The following examples demonstrate its usage.</p>
        <aside class="example">
          <!-- ReSpec needs these examples to be unindented. -->
          <pre class="example highlight html">
&lt;div id="inaccessibleButton"&gt;

// Get a reference to the element.
let el = document.getElementById('inaccessibleButton');
el.tabIndex = 0; // Make it focusable.

// Set the role and label.
el.role = "button";
el.ariaLabel = "Edit";

// Get the role and label.
el.role; // Returns "button"
el.ariaLabel; // Returns "Edit"

// These are interchangeable with the more verbose setAttribute and getAttribute methods.
el.setAttribute("role", "button");
el.setAttribute("aria-label", "Edit");
el.getAttribute("role"); // Returns "button"
el.getAttribute("aria-label"); // Returns "Edit"

// Changes via either interface are reflected by the other.
el.setAttribute("aria-label", "Delete");
el.ariaLabel; // Returns "Delete"
el.ariaLabel = "Publish";
el.getAttribute("aria-label"); // Returns "Publish"</pre

        In accordance with <a data-cite="design-principles#do-not-expose-use-of-assistive-tech">Web Platform Design Principles</a>, this specification provides no programmatic interface to determine
        if information is being used by Assistive Technologies. However, this specification does allow an author to present different information to users of Assistive Technologies from the
        information available to users who do not use Assistive Technologies. This is possible using many features of the ARIA specification, just as this is possible using many other parts of the web
        technology stack. This content disparity could be abused to perform <a data-cite="fingerprinting-guidance#active-0">active fingerprinting</a> of users of Assistive Technologies.

      <h2>Mapping WAI-ARIA Value types to languages</h2>
      <p class="note">
        The HTML column of the table below is advisory. Guidance on use of WAI-ARIA state and properties in HTML is provided in
        <a data-cite="html-aria/#docconformance">Document conformance requirements for use of ARIA attributes in HTML</a> ([[HTML-ARIA]]).
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The suggested mappings for true/false values in HTML use <a data-cite="html/common-microsyntaxes.html#keywords-and-enumerated-attributes">Keyword and enumerated attributes</a> with allowed
        values of <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, instead of using the HTML boolean value type.
        <!--@@ can't rely on attribute absence because of default value in true/false/undefined case.-->
      </p>
      <p>The table below provides recommended mappings between WAI-ARIA state and property types and attribute types from [[[HTML]]] and [[[XMLSCHEMA11-2]]].</p>
      <p>
        Languages not listed below might have appropriate value types defined in the language. If they do not, we recommend XML Schema Datatypes for general purpose XML languages. Documents using DTDs
        instead of schemas will not be able to validate automatically and require additional processing on WAI-ARIA attributes.
