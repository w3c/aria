	<p>Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about widgets, structures, and behaviors, in order to allow assistive technologies to convey appropriate information to persons with disabilities. This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. These semantics are designed to allow an author to properly convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies in document-level markup. This version adds features new since WAI-ARIA 1.1 [[wai-aria-1.1]] to improve interoperability with assistive technologies to form a more consistent accessibility model for [[HTML]] and [[SVG2]].

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>The goals of this specification include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>expanding the accessibility information that may be supplied by the author;</li>
		<li>requiring that supporting host languages provide full keyboard support that may be implemented in a device-independent way, for example, by telephones, handheld devices, e-book readers, and televisions;</li>

	</ul>
	<p>WAI-ARIA is a technical specification that provides a framework to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. This document is primarily for developers creating custom widgets and other web application components. Please see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA Overview</a> for links to related documents for other audiences, such as <cite><a href="" class="practices"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</a></cite> [[WAI-ARIA-PRACTICES-1.2]] that introduces developers to the accessibility problems that WAI-ARIA is intended to solve, the fundamental concepts, and the technical approach of WAI-ARIA.</p>
	<p>This document currently handles two aspects of <a>roles</a>: user interface functionality and structural <a>relationships</a>. For more information and use cases, see <cite><a href="" class="practices"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</a></cite> [[WAI-ARIA-PRACTICES-1.2]] for the use of roles in making interactive content accessible.</p>
	<p>Roles defined by this specification are designed to support the roles used by platform <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a>. Declaration of these roles on elements within dynamic web content is intended to support interoperability between the web content and assistive technologies that utilize <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a>.</p>
	<p>The schema to support this standard has been designed to be extensible so that custom roles can be created by extending base roles. This allows <a>user agents</a> to support at least the base role, and user agents that support the custom role can provide enhanced access. Note that much of this could be formalized in [[XMLSCHEMA11-2]]. However, being able to define similarities between roles, such as <a href="#baseConcept">baseConcepts</a> and more descriptive definitions, would not be available in <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language Schema Datatypes">XSD</abbr>.</p>
	<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 1.2 is a member of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 1.2 suite</a> that defines how to expose semantics of WAI-ARIA and other web content languages to <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a>.

		<h2>Rich Internet Application Accessibility</h2>
		<p>The domain of web accessibility defines how to make web content usable by persons with disabilities. Persons with certain types of disabilities use <a>assistive technologies</a> (<abbr title="Assistive Technologies">AT</abbr>) to interact with content. Assistive technologies can transform the presentation of content into a format more suitable to the user, and can allow the user to interact in different ways. For example, the user may need to, or choose to, interact with a slider widget via arrow keys, instead of dragging and dropping with a mouse. In order to accomplish this effectively, the software needs to understand the <a>semantics</a> of the content. Semantics is the science of meaning; in this case, used to assign roles, states, and properties that apply to user interface and content elements as a human would understand. For instance, if a paragraph is semantically identified as such, assistive technologies can interact with it as a unit separable from the rest of the content, knowing the exact boundaries of that paragraph. An adjustable range slider or collapsible list (a.k.a. a tree <a>widget</a>) are more complex examples, in which various parts of the widget have semantics that need to be properly identified for assistive technologies to support effective interaction.</p>
		<p>New technologies often overlook semantics required for accessibility, and new authoring practices often misuse the intended semantics of those technologies. <a>Elements</a> that have one defined meaning in the language are used with a different meaning intended to be understood by the user.</p>
		<p>For example, web application developers create collapsible tree widgets in HTML using CSS and JavaScript even though HTML has no semantic <code>tree</code> element. To a non-disabled user, it may look and act like a collapsible tree widget, but without appropriate semantics, the tree widget may not be <a>perceivable</a> to, or <a>operable</a> by, a person with a disability because assistive technologies may not recognize the role. Similarly, web application developers create interactive button widgets in SVG using JavaScript even though SVG has no semantic <code>button</code> element. To a non-disabled user, it may look and act like a button widget, but without appropriate semantics, the button widget may not be <a>perceivable</a> to, or <a>operable</a> by, a person with a disability because assistive technologies may not recognize the role.</p>
		<p>The incorporation of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a way for an author to provide proper semantics for custom widgets to make these widgets accessible, usable, and interoperable with assistive technologies. This specification identifies the types of widgets and structures that are commonly recognized by accessibility products, by providing an <a>ontology</a> of corresponding <a>roles</a> that can be attached to content. This allows elements with a given role to be understood as a particular widget or structural type regardless of any semantics inherited from the implementing host language. Roles are a common property of platform <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a> which assistive technologies use to provide the user with effective presentation and interaction.</p>
		<p>The Roles Model includes interaction <a>widgets</a> and elements denoting document structure. The Roles Model describes inheritance and details the <a>attributes</a> each role supports. Information about mapping of roles to accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr> is provided by the <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite> [[CORE-AAM-1.2]].</p>
		<p>Roles are element types and will not change with time or user actions. Role information is used by assistive technologies, through interaction with the user agent, to provide normal processing of the specified element type.</p>
		<p>States and properties are used to declare important attributes of an element that affect and describe interaction. They enable the <a>user agent</a> and operating system to properly handle the element even when the attributes are dynamically changed by client-side scripts. For example, alternative input and output technology, such as screen readers and speech dictation software, need to be able to recognize and effectively manipulate and communicate various interaction states (e.g., disabled, checked) to the user.</p>
		<p>While it is possible for assistive technologies to access these properties directly through the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dom/">Document Object Model</a></cite> [[DOM]], the preferred mechanism is for the user agent to map the states and properties to the accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">API</abbr> of the operating system. See the <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite> [[CORE-AAM-1.2]] and the <cite><a href="" class="accname">Accessible Name and Description Computation</a></cite> [[ACCNAME-1.2]] for details.</p>
		<p id="desc_contractmodel">Figure 1.0 illustrates the relationship between user agents (e.g., browsers), accessibility APIs, and assistive technologies. It describes the "contract" provided by the user agent to assistive technologies, which includes typical accessibility information found in the accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">API</abbr> for many of our accessible platforms for GUIs (role, state, selection, <a>event</a> notification, <a>relationship</a> information, and descriptions). The DOM, usually HTML, acts as the data model and view in a typical model-view-controller relationship, and JavaScript acts as the controller by manipulating the style and content of the displayed data. The user agent conveys relevant information to the operating system's accessibility API, which can be used by any assistive technologies, such as screen readers.</p>

		<p>For more information see <cite><a href="" class="practices"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</a></cite> for the use of roles in making interactive content accessible.</p>
		<p>Users of alternate input devices need <a>keyboard accessible</a> content. The new semantics, when combined with the recommended keyboard interactions provided in <cite><a href="" class="practices"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</a></cite>, will allow alternate input solutions to facilitate command and control via an alternate input solution.</p>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> introduces navigational <a>landmarks</a> through its Roles Model and the <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> role landmarks, which can help persons with dexterity and vision impairments by providing for improved keyboard navigation. <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> may also be used to assist persons with cognitive learning disabilities. The additional semantics allow authors to restructure and substitute alternative content as needed.</p>
		<p><a>Assistive technologies</a> need the ability to support alternative inputs by getting and setting the current value of <a>widget</a> states and properties. Assistive technologies also need to determine what <a>objects</a> are selected and manage widgets that allow multiple selections, such as list boxes and grids.</p>
		<p>Speech-based command and control systems can benefit from <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics like the <code>role</code> attribute to assist in conveying audio information to the user. For example, upon encountering an element with a role of <rref>menu</rref> with child elements of role <rref>menuitem</rref> each containing text content representing a different flavor, a speech system might state to the user, "Select one of three choices: chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla."</p>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to be used as a supplement for native language semantics, not a replacement. When the host language provides a feature that provides equivalent accessibility to the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature, use the host language feature. <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> should only be used in cases where the host language lacks the needed <a>role</a>, <a>state</a>, and <a>property</a> indicators. Use a host language feature that is as similar as possible to the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature, then refine the meaning by adding <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. For instance, a multi-selectable grid could be implemented as a table, and then <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> used to clarify that it is an interactive grid, not just a static data table. This allows for the best possible fallback for user agents that do not support <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and preserves the integrity of the host language semantics.</p>

		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>This specification defines the basic model for <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, including roles, states, properties, and values. It impacts several audiences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a>User agents</a> that process content containing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features;</li>
			<li><a>Assistive technologies</a> that present content in special ways to user with disabilities;</li>
			<li>Authors who create content;</li>
			<li>Authoring tools that help authors create conforming content; and</li>
			<li>Conformance checkers that verify appropriate use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each conformance requirement indicates the audience to which it applies.</p>
		<p>Although this specification is applicable to the above audiences, it is not specifically targeted to, nor is it intended to be the sole source of information for, any of these audiences. The following documents provide important supporting information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>[[[WAI-ARIA-PRACTICES-1.2]]] addresses authoring recommendations for HTML, and is also of interest to developers of authoring tools and conformance checkers.</li>
			<li>[[[CORE-AAM-1.2]]]</cite> addresses developers of <a class="termref">user agents</a> and <a class="termref">assistive technologies</a>.</li>
			<li>[[[ACCNAME-1.2]]] also addresses developers of <a class="termref">user agents</a> and <a class="termref">assistive technologies</a>.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section id="ua-support">
		<h2>User Agent Support</h2>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> relies on user agent support for its features in two ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mainstream <a>user agents</a> use <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> to alter how host language features are exposed to <a>accessibility APIs</a> in order to improve accessibility. The mechanism for this is defined in the <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite>.</li>
			<li><a>Assistive technologies</a> use the enhanced information available in an accessibility API, or uses the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup directly via the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>, to convey semantic and interaction information to the user.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Aside from using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup to improve what is exposed to accessibility APIs, user agents behave as they would natively. Assistive technologies react to the extra information in the accessibility API as they already do for the same information on non-web content. User agents that are not assistive technologies, however, need do nothing beyond providing appropriate updates to the accessibility API.</p>
		<p>The <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> specification neither requires nor forbids user agents from enhancing native presentation and interaction behaviors on the basis of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup. Mainstream user agents might expose <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> navigational landmarks (for example, as a dialog box or through a keyboard command) with the intention to facilitate navigation for all users. User agents are encouraged to maximize their usefulness to users, including users without disabilities. </p>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to provide missing semantics so that the intent of the author may be conveyed to assistive technologies. Generally, authors using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> will provide the appropriate presentation and interaction features. Over time, host languages may add <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> equivalents, such as new form controls, that are implemented as standard accessible user interface controls by the user agent. This allows authors to use them instead of custom <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> enabled user interface components. In this case the user agent would support the native host language feature. Developers of host languages that implement <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> are advised to continue supporting <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics when they do not adversely conflict with implicit host language semantics, as <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics more clearly reflect the intent of the author if the host language features are inadequate to meet the author's needs.</p>
		</section>
	<section id="co-evolution">
		<h2>Co-Evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h2>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like [[HTML]] and [[SVG2]], or to be used as an accessibility enhancement technology in other markup-based languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. It clarifies semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of objects, via style and script, that are not yet directly supported by the language of the page, because the invention of new types of objects is faster than standardized support for them appears in web languages.</p>
		<p>It is not appropriate to create objects with style and script when the host language provides a semantic element for that type of object. While <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can improve the accessibility of these objects, accessibility is best provided by allowing the user agent to handle the object natively. For example, it's better to use an <code>h1</code> element in HTML than to use the <rref>heading</rref> role on a <code>div</code> element.</p>
		<p>It is expected that, over time, host languages will evolve to provide semantics for objects that currently can only be declared with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. This is natural and desirable, as one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to help stimulate the emergence of more semantic and accessible markup. When native semantics for a given feature become available, it is appropriate for authors to use the native feature and stop using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for that feature. Legacy content may continue to use <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, however, so the need for user agents to support <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> remains.</p>
		<p>While specific features of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> may lose importance over time, the general possibility of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> to add semantics to web pages is expected to be a persistent need. Host languages may not implement all the semantics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> provides, and various host languages may implement different subsets of the features. New types of objects are continually being developed, and one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to provide a way to make such objects accessible, because web authoring practices often advance faster than host language standards. In this way, <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages both evolve together but at different rates.</p>
		<p>Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example, SVG expresses the semantics behind production of graphical objects, not of user interface components that those objects may represent. Host languages might, by design, not provide native semantics that map to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features. In these cases, <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> could be adopted as a long-term approach to add semantic information to user interface components.</p>

		<h2>Authoring Practices</h2>
		<section id="authoring_tools">
			<h3>Authoring Tools</h3>
			<p>Many of the requirements in the definitions of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a>roles</a>, <a>states</a>, and <a>properties</a> can be checked automatically during the development process, similar to other quality control processes used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating custom widgets, authoring tools may compare widget roles, states, and properties to those supported in <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> as well as those supported in related and cross-referenced roles, states, and properties. Authoring tools may notify authors of errors in widget design patterns, and may also prompt developers for information that cannot be determined from context alone. For example, a scripting library can determine the labels for the tree items in a tree view, but would need to prompt the author to label the entire tree. To help authors visualize a logical accessibility structure, an authoring environment might provide an outline view of a web resource based on the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup.</p>
			<p>In both HTML and SVG, <code>tabindex</code> is an important way browsers support keyboard <a href="#host_general_focus">focus navigation</a> for implementations of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>; authoring and debugging tools may check to make sure <code>tabindex</code> values are properly set. For example, error conditions may include cases where more than one treeitem in a tree has a <code>tabindex</code> value greater than or equal to 0, where <code>tabindex</code> is not set on any treeitem, or where <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> is not defined when the element with the role tree has a <code>tabindex</code> value of greater than or equal to 0.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="authoring_testing">
			<h3>Testing Practices and Tools</h3>
			<p>The accessibility of interactive content cannot be confirmed by static checks alone. Developers of interactive content should test for device-independent access to <a>widgets</a> and applications, and should verify accessibility <abbr title="application programing interface">API</abbr> access to all content and changes during user interaction.</p>

		<h2>Assistive Technologies</h2>
		<p>Programmatic access to accessibility semantics is essential for assistive technologies. Most assistive technologies interact with user agents, like other applications, through a recognized accessibility API. Perceivable objects in the user interface are exposed to assistive technologies as accessible objects, defined by the accessibility API interfaces. To do this properly, accessibility information – role, states, properties as well as contextual information – needs to be accurately conveyed to the assistive technologies through the accessibility API. When a state change occurs, the user agent provides the appropriate event notification to the accessibility API. Contextual information, in many host languages like HTML, can be determined from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> itself as it provides a contextual tree hierarchy.</p>
		<p>While some assistive technologies interact with these accessibility APIs, others may access the content directly from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>. These technologies can restructure, simplify, style, or reflow the content to help a different set of users. Common use cases for these types of adaptations may be the aging population, persons with cognitive impairments, or persons in environments that interfere with use of their tools. For example, the availability of regional navigational landmarks may allow for a mobile device adaptation that shows only portions of the content at any one time based on its semantics. This could reduce the amount of information the user needs to process at any one time. In other situations it may be appropriate to replace a custom user interface control with something that is easier to navigate with a keyboard, or touch screen device.</p>

	<h1>Important Terms</h1>
	<div>
		<p>While some terms are defined in place, the following definitions are used throughout this document. </p>
		<dl class="termlist">
			<dt><dfn data-export=""  data-lt="accessibility api|accessibility apis">Accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></dfn></dt>
			<dd>
			  <p>Operating systems and other platforms provide a set of interfaces that expose information about <a class="termref" data-lt="object">objects</a> and <a class="termref" data-lt="event">events</a> to <a>assistive technologies</a>. Assistive technologies use these interfaces to get information about and interact with those <a class="termref" data-lt="widget">widgets</a>. Examples of accessibility APIs are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/microsoft-active-accessibility">Microsoft Active Accessibility</a> [[MSAA]], <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32">Microsoft User Interface Automation</a> [[UI-AUTOMATION]], <abbr title="Microsoft Active Accessibility">MSAA</abbr> with <cite><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winauto/iaccessibleex"><abbr title="User Interface Automation">UIA</abbr> Express</a></cite> [[UIA-EXPRESS]], the
				  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsaccessibility">Mac <abbr title="OS Ten">OS X</abbr> Accessibility Protocol</a> [[AXAPI]], the <cite><a href="https://developer.gnome.org/atk/unstable/">Linux/Unix Accessibility Toolkit</a></cite> [[ATK]] and <cite><a href="https://developer.gnome.org/libatspi/stable/">Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface</a></cite> [[AT-SPI]], and <a href="https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/accessibility/iaccessible2/start">IAccessible2</a> [[IAccessible2]].</p>
			</dd>
			<dt><dfn data-export="" >Accessible Description</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
			  <p>An accessible description provides additional information, related to an interface element, that complements the <a>accessible name</a>. The accessible description might or might not be visually perceivable. </p>
			</dd>
			<dt><dfn data-export="" data-lt="accessible name|accessible names">Accessible Name</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
			  <p>The accessible name is the name of a user interface element. Each platform <a>accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr></a> provides the accessible name property. The value of the accessible name may be derived from a visible (e.g., the visible text on a button) or invisible (e.g., the text alternative that describes an icon) property of the user interface element.  See related <a>accessible description</a>.</p>
			  <p>A simple use for the accessible name property may be illustrated by an &quot;OK&quot; button. The text &quot;OK&quot; is the accessible name. When the button receives focus, assistive technologies may concatenate the platform's role description with the accessible name. For example, a screen reader may speak &quot;push-button OK&quot; or &quot;OK button&quot;. The order of concatenation and specifics of the role description (e.g., &quot;button&quot;, &quot;push-button&quot;, &quot;clickable button&quot;) are determined by platform <a class="termref" data-lt="accessibility api">accessibility API</a>s or <a>assistive technologies</a>.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt><dfn data-export="" data-lt="accessible object|accessible objects">Accessible object</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
			  <p>A <a>node</a> in the <a class="termref">accessibility tree</a> of a platform <a>accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr></a>. Accessible objects expose various <a class="termref" data-lt="state">states</a>, <a class="termref" data-lt="property">properties</a>, and <a class="termref" data-lt="event">events</a> for use by <a>assistive technologies</a>.  In the context of markup languages (e.g., HTML and SVG) in general, and of WAI-ARIA in particular, markup <a class="termref" data-lt="element">elements</a> and their <a class="termref" data-lt="attribute">attributes</a> are represented as accessible objects.  </p>

						<li>works with a user agent or web content itself through the use of APIs, and</li>
						<li>provides services beyond those offered by the user agent to facilitate user interaction with web content by people with disabilities</li>
					</ul>

			<dd>
			  <p>A type of region on a page to which the user may want quick access. Content in such a region is different from that of other regions on the page and relevant to a specific user purpose, such as navigating, searching, perusing the primary content, etc.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt><dfn data-export="" data-lt="live region|live regions">Live Region</dfn></dt>
			<dd>
			  <p>Live regions are perceivable regions of a web page that are typically updated as a result of an external event when user focus may be elsewhere. These regions are not always updated as a result of a user interaction. Examples of live regions include a chat log, stock ticker, or a sport scoring section that updates periodically to reflect game statistics. Since these asynchronous areas are expected to update outside the user's area of focus, assistive technologies such as screen readers have either been unaware of their existence or unable to process them for the user. WAI-ARIA has provided a collection of properties that allow the author to identify these live regions and process them: aria-live, aria-relevant, aria-atomic, and aria-busy.</p>

			<dd>
			  <p><a>Accessibility API</a> <a>state</a> that is controlled by the user agent, such as focus and selection. These are contrasted with &quot;unmanaged states&quot; that are typically controlled by the author. Nevertheless, authors can override some managed states, such as aria-posinset and aria-setsize. Many managed states have corresponding CSS pseudo-classes, such as :focus, and pseudo-elements, such as ::selection, that are also updated by the user agent.</p>

		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> provides a collection of accessibility <a>states</a> and <a>properties</a> which are used to support platform <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr></a> on various operating system platforms. <a>Assistive technologies</a> may access this information through an exposed <a>user agent</a> DOM or through a mapping to the platform accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">API</abbr>. When combined with <a>roles</a>, the user agent can supply the assistive technologies with user interface information to convey to the user at any time. Changes in states or properties will result in a notification to assistive technologies, which could alert the user that a change has occurred.</p>
		<p>In the following example, a list item (<code>html:li</code>) has been used to create a checkable menu item, and JavaScript <a>events</a> will capture mouse and keyboard events to toggle the value of <sref>aria-checked</sref>. A role is used to make the behavior of this simple <a>widget</a> known to the user agent. <a>Attributes</a> that change with user actions (such as <sref>aria-checked</sref>) are defined in the <a href="#states_and_properties">states and properties</a> section.</p>

		<p>Some accessibility states, called <em><a>managed states</a></em>, are controlled by the user agent. Examples of managed state include keyboard focus and selection. Managed states often have corresponding <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> pseudo-classes (such as <code>:focus</code> and <code>::selection</code>) to define style changes. In contrast, the states in this specification are typically controlled by the author and are called <em>unmanaged states.</em> Some states are managed by the user agent, such as <pref>aria-posinset</pref> and <pref>aria-setsize</pref>, but the author can override them if the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> is incomplete and would cause the user agent calculation to be incorrect. User agents map both managed and unmanaged states to the platform accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr>.</p>
		<p>Most modern user agents support <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-selectors"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> attribute selectors</a></cite> ([[CSS3-SELECTORS]]), and can allow the author to create <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> changes based on <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attribute information, reducing the amount of scripts necessary to achieve equivalent functionality. In the following example, a <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> selector is used to determine whether or not the text is bold and an image of a check mark is shown, based on the value of the <sref>aria-checked</sref> attribute.</p>

[aria-checked=&quot;true&quot;]::before { background-image: url(checked.gif); }</pre>

	  <h2>Managing Focus and Supporting Keyboard Navigation</h2>
	  <p>When using standard <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> interactive elements and simple <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a>widgets</a>, application developers can manipulate the tab order or associate keyboard shortcuts with elements in the document.</p>
	  <p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> includes a number of &quot;managing container&quot; widgets, also known as &quot;composite&quot; widgets. When appropriate, the container is responsible for tracking the last descendant that was active (the default is usually the first item in the container). It is essential that a container maintain a usable and consistent strategy when focus leaves a container and is then later refocused. While there may be exceptions, it is recommended that when a previously focused container is refocused, the active descendant be the same element as the active descendant when the container was last focused. Exceptions include cases where the contents of a container widget have changed, and widgets like a menubar where the user expects to always return to the first item when focus leaves the menu bar. For example, if the second item of a tree group was the active descendant when the user tabbed out of the tree group, then the second item of the tree group remains the active descendant when the tree group gets focus again. The user may also activate the container by clicking on one of the descendants within it. When the container or its active descendant has focus, the user may navigate through the container by pressing additional keys, such as the arrow keys, to change the currently active descendant. Any additional press of the main navigation key (generally the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key) will move out of the container to the next widget.</p>
	  <p>Usable keyboard navigation in a rich internet application is different from the tabbing paradigm among interactive elements, such as links and form controls, in a static document. In rich internet applications, the user tabs to significantly complex <a class="termref">widgets</a>, such as a menu or spreadsheet, and uses the arrow keys to navigate within the widget. The changes that <abbr title="accessible rich internet applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> introduces to keyboard navigation make this enhanced accessibility possible. In <abbr title="accessible rich internet applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, any element can be keyboard focusable. In addition to host language mechanisms such as <code>tabindex</code>, <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> provides another mechanism for keyboard operation. Most other aspects of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> widget development depend on keyboard navigation functioning properly.</p>
          <p>
            When implementing <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> as described below, the user agent keeps the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus on the container element or on an input element that controls the container element.
            However, the user agent communicates <a>desktop focus events</a> and states to the assistive technology as if the element referenced by <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> has focus.
            User agents are not expected to validate that the active descendant is a descendant of the container element.
            It is the responsibility of the user agent to ensure that keyboard events are processed at the <a>element</a> that has <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus.
            Any keyboard events directed at the active descendant bubble up to the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> element with focus for processing.
          </p>
	  <section id="managingfocus_authors">
	    <h3>Information for Authors</h3>
	    <p>If the author removes the element with focus, the author SHOULD move focus to a logical element. Similarly, authors SHOULD not scroll the element with focus off screen unless the user performed a scrolling action.</p>
	    <p>Authors SHOULD ensure that all interactive <a>elements</a> are focusable and that all parts of composite widgets are either focusable or have a documented alternative method to achieve their function.</p>
	    <p>Authors MUST manage focus on the following container roles:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li><rref>grid</rref></li>
	      <li><rref>listbox</rref></li>
	      <li><rref>menu</rref></li>
	      <li><rref>menubar</rref></li>
	      <li><rref>radiogroup</rref></li>
	      <li><rref>tree</rref></li>
	      <li><rref>treegrid</rref></li>
	      <li><rref>tablist</rref></li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>User agents that support <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> expand the usage of host language mechanisms such as <code>tabindex</code>, <code>focus</code>, and <code>blur</code> to allow them on all <a>elements</a>. Where the host language supports it, authors MAY add any element such as a <code>div</code>, <code>span</code>, or <code>img</code> to the default tab order by setting <code>tabindex=&quot;0&quot;</code>. In addition, any item with <code>tabindex</code> equal to a negative integer is focusable via script or a mouse click, but is not part of the default tab order. This is supported in both [[HTML]] and [[SVG2]].</p>
	    <p>
        Authors MAY use <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> to inform <a>assistive technologies</a> which descendant of a <rref>widget</rref> element is treated as having keyboard focus in the user interface if the role of the widget element supports <code>aria-activedescendant</code>.
        This is often a more convenient way of providing keyboard navigation within widgets, such as a <rref>listbox</rref>, where the widget occupies only one stop in the page <kbd>Tab</kbd> sequence and other keys, typically arrow keys, are used to focus elements inside the widget.
      </p>
	    <p>Typically, the author will use host language <a>semantics</a> to put the widget in the <kbd>Tab</kbd> sequence (e.g., <code>tabindex="0"</code> in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>) and <code>aria-activedescendant</code> to point to the ID of the currently active descendant. The author, not the user agent, is responsible for styling the currently active descendant to show it has keyboard focus. The author cannot use <code>:<span class="css-selector">focus</span></code> to style the currently active descendant since the actual focus is on the container.</p>
	    <p>More information on managing focus can be found in the <a href="#keyboard" class="practices">Developing a Keyboard Interface</a> section of the <cite><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</cite>.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section id="managingfocus_useragents">
	    <h3>Information for User Agents</h3>
	    <p>The user agent MUST do the following to implement <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Implement the host language method for keyboard navigation so that widgets that support <code>aria-activedescendant</code> may be included in the tab order.</li>
	      <li>For platforms that expose <a>desktop focus</a> or <a>accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">API</abbr></a> focus separately from <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus, do not expose the focused state in the accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> for any element when it has <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus and also has <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> which points to a valid <a href="#valuetype_idref">ID reference</a>.</li>
	      <li>When the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute changes on an element that currently has <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus, remove the focused state from the previously focused object and fire an accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> <a>desktop focus event</a> on the new element referenced by <code>aria-activedescendant</code>. If <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> is cleared or does not point to an element in the current document, fire a desktop focus event for the <a>object</a> that had the attribute change.</li>
	      <li>Apply the following accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> states to any element with an ID attribute that can be referenced by an element with both an <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute and has <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus. There are two ways an element can be referenced by <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>. One way is when it is <a>owned</a> by an element with <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> and the other is when it is <a>owned</a> by an element that is controlled by an element with role of <rref>combobox</rref>, <rref>textbox</rref> or <rref>searchbox</rref> with an <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute:
		<ol>
		  <li>Focusable, if the element also has a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a class="termref">role</a>. The element needs to be focusable because it could be referenced by the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute. Native elements that have no <a class="termref">role</a> attribute do not need to be checked; their native semantics determine the focusable state.</li>
		  <li>Focused, whenever the element is the target of the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute and the element with the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute has <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus.</li>
		</ol>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>When an assistive technology uses its platform's accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr> to request a change of focus, user agents MUST do the following:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Remove the platform's focused state from the previously focused object.</li>
	      <li>Set the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus:
		<ol>
		  <li>If the <a class="termref">element</a> can take <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus, the <a class="termref">user agent</a> MUST set the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus to it.</li>
		  <li>Otherwise, if the element being focused has an ID and the ID is referenced by the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute of an element that is focusable, the user agent MUST set <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> focus to the element that has the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute.
		  	<p class="note">An element with an ID can be referenced when it is <a>owned</a> by a container element that has the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute or by a container element that is controlled by an element that has the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute  (e.g. see <rref>combobox</rref>).  Otherwise the <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> attribute reference indicates an author error.</p>

		<section id="superclassrole">
			<h3>Superclass Role</h3>
			<p>The <a>role</a> that the current subclassed role extends in the Roles Model. This extension causes all the properties and constraints of the superclass role to propagate to the subclass role.

			<h3>Related Concepts</h3>
			<p>Informative data about a similar or related idea from other specifications. Concepts that are related are not necessarily identical. Related concepts do not inherit properties from each other. Hence if the definition of one concept changes, the properties, behavior, and definition of its related concept is not affected.</p>
			<p>For example, a progress bar is like a status indicator. Therefore, the <rref>progressbar</rref> <a>widget</a> has a related concept which includes <rref>status</rref>.

A base concept is like a <a href="#relatedConcept">related concept</a> except that the base concept is almost identical to the role definition.</p>
			<p>For example, the <rref>checkbox</rref> defined in this document has similar functionality and anticipated behavior to a <code>&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;</code> defined in [[HTML]]. Therefore, a <rref>checkbox</rref> has an [[HTML]] <code>checkbox</code> as a <code>baseConcept</code>.

When a widget is missing <em>required owned elements</em> due to script execution or loading, authors MUST mark a containing element with <sref>aria-busy</sref> equal to <code>true</code>. For example, until a page is fully initialized and complete, an author could mark the document element as busy.</p>
			<p class="note">A role that has 'required owned elements' does not imply the reverse relationship. While processing of a role may be incomplete without elements of given roles present as descendants, elements with roles in this list do not always have to be found within elements of the given role. See <a href="#scope">required context role</a> for requirements about the context where elements of a given role will be contained.</p>
			<p class="note">An element with a <a href="#subclassroles">subclass role</a> of the 'required owned element' does not fulfill this requirement. For example, the <rref>listbox</rref> role requires ownership of an element using the <rref>option</rref> or <rref>group</rref> role. Although the <rref>group</rref> role is the superclass of <rref>row</rref>, adding an <a>owned</a> element with a role of <rref>row</rref> will not fulfill the requirement that <rref>listbox</rref> owns an <rref>option</rref> or a <rref>group</rref>.</p>

			<h3>Required Context Role</h3>
			<p>The required context role defines the owning container where this <a>role</a> is allowed. If a role has a required context, authors MUST ensure that an element with the role is contained inside (or <a>owned</a> by) an element with the required context role. For example, an element with role <code>listitem</code> is only meaningful when contained inside (or <a>owned</a> by) an element with role <code>list</code>.</p>
			<p class="note">A role that has 'required context role' does not imply the reverse relationship.

				<p>Alerts are used to convey messages that may be immediately important to users. In the case of audio warnings, alerts provide an accessible alternative for hearing-impaired users. The <code>alert</code> <a>role</a> is applied to the element containing the alert message. An <code>alert</code> is a specialized form of the <rref>status</rref> role, which is processed as an atomic <a>live region</a>.</p>

				<p>Neither authors nor user agents are required to set or manage focus to an alert in order for it to be processed. Since alerts are not required to receive focus, authors SHOULD NOT require users to close an alert. If an author desires focus to move to a message when it is conveyed, the author SHOULD use <rref>alertdialog</rref> instead of <code>alert</code>.</p>

				<p>A <rref>structure</rref> containing one or more focusable elements requiring user input, such as keyboard or gesture events, that do not follow a standard interaction pattern supported by a <rref>widget</rref> role.</p>
				<p>Some <a>user agents</a> and <a>assistive technologies</a> have a browse mode where standard input events, such as up and down arrow key events, are intercepted and used to control a reading cursor. This browse mode behavior prevents elements that do not have a <rref>widget</rref> role from receiving and using such keyboard and gesture events to provide interactive functionality.</p>
				<p>When there is a need to create an element with an interaction model that is not supported by any of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <rref>widget</rref> roles, authors MAY give that element role <code>application</code>. And, when a user navigates into an element with role <code>application</code>, <a>assistive technologies</a> that intercept standard input events SHOULD switch to a mode that passes most or all standard input events through to the web application.</p>
				<p>For example, a presentation slide editor uses arrow keys to change the positions of textbox and image elements on the slide. There are not any WAI-ARIA <rref>widget</rref> roles that correspond to such an interaction model so an author could give the slide container role <code>application</code>, an <pref>aria-roledescription</pref> of &quot;Slide Editor&quot;, and use <pref>aria-describedby</pref> to provide instructions.</p>
				<p> Because only the focusable elements contained in an <code>application</code> element are accessible to users of some assistive technologies, authors MUST use one of the following techniques to ensure all non-decorative static text or image content inside an application is accessible:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Associate the content with a focusable element using <pref>aria-labelledby</pref> or <pref>aria-describedby</pref>.</li>
					<li>Place the content in a focusable element that has role <rref>document</rref> or <rref>article</rref>.</li>
					<li>Manage focus of <a>owned</a> elements as described in <a href="#managingfocus">Managing Focus</a>, updating the value of <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> to reference the <a>element</a> containing the focused content.</li>

				<p>A section of a page that consists of a composition that forms an independent part of a document, page, or site.</p>
				<p>An article is not a navigational <a>landmark</a>, but may be nested to form a discussion where assistive technologies could pay attention to article nesting to assist the user in following the discussion. An article could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a web log entry, a user-submitted comment, or any other independent item of content. It is <em>independent</em> in that its contents could stand alone, for example in syndication. However, the <a>element</a> is still associated with its ancestors; for instance, contact information that applies to a parent body element still covers the article as well. When nesting articles, the child articles represent content that is related to the content of the parent article. For instance, a web log entry on a site that accepts user-submitted comments could represent the comments as articles nested within the article for the web log entry. Author, heading, date, or other information associated with an article does not apply to nested articles.</p>
				<p>When the user navigates to an element assigned the role of <code>article</code>, <a>assistive technologies</a> that typically intercept standard keyboard events SHOULD switch to document browsing mode, as opposed to passing keyboard events through to the web application. Assistive technologies MAY provide a feature allowing the user to navigate the hierarchy of any nested <code>article</code> elements.</p>
				<p>When an <code>article</code> is in the context of a <rref>feed</rref>, the author MAY specify values for <pref>aria-posinset</pref> and <pref>aria-setsize</pref>.</p>

				<p>An <rref>input</rref> that controls another element, such as a <rref>listbox</rref> or <rref>grid</rref>, that can dynamically pop up to help the user set the value of the <rref>input</rref>.</p>
				<p class="ednote" title="Major Changes to combobox role in ARIA 1.2">
					The Guidance for <rref>combobox</rref> has changed significantly in ARIA 1.2 due to problems with implementation of the previous patterns.
					Authors and developers of User Agents, Assistive Technologies, and Conformance Checkers are advised to review this section carefully to understand the changes.
          			Explanation of the changes is available in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/aria/wiki/Resolving-ARIA-1.1-Combobox-Issues">ARIA repository wiki</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
				A <code>combobox</code> functionally combines a named input field with the ability to assist value selection via a supplementary popup element.
				A <code>combobox</code> input MAY be either a single-line text field that supports editing and typing or an element that only displays the current value of the <code>combobox</code>.
				If the <code>combobox</code> supports text input and provides autocompletion behavior as described in <pref>aria-autocomplete</pref>, authors MUST set <pref>aria-autocomplete</pref> on the <code>combobox</code> element to the value that corresponds to the provided behavior.
				</p>
				<p>
				Typically, the initial state of a <code>combobox</code> is collapsed.
				In the collapsed state, only the <code>combobox</code> element and a separate, optional popup control <rref>button</rref> are visible.
				A <code>combobox</code> is said to be expanded when both the <code>combobox</code> element showing its current value and its associated popup element are visible.
				Authors MUST set <sref>aria-expanded</sref> to <code>true</code> on an element with role <code>combobox</code> when it is expanded and <code>false</code> when it is collapsed.
				</p>
				<p>
				Authors MUST ensure the popup element associated with a <code>combobox</code> has a role of <rref>listbox</rref>, <rref>tree</rref>, <rref>grid</rref>, or <rref>dialog</rref>.
				When the popup is displayed, authors MUST set <pref>aria-controls</pref> on a <code>combobox</code> element to a value that refers to the <code>combobox</code> popup element.
				</p>
				<p>
				Elements with the role <code>combobox</code> have an implicit <pref>aria-haspopup</pref> value of <code>listbox</code>.
				If the <code>combobox</code> popup element has a role other than <rref>listbox</rref>, authors MUST specify a value for <pref>aria-haspopup</pref> that corresponds to the role of its popup.
				</p>
				<p>
				If the user interface includes an additional icon that allows the visibility of the popup to be controlled via pointer and touch events, authors SHOULD ensure that element has role <rref>button</rref>, that it is focusable but not included in the page <kbd>Tab</kbd> sequence, and that it is not a descendant of the element with role <code>combobox</code>.
				In addition, to be keyboard accessible, authors SHOULD provide keyboard mechanisms for moving focus between the <code>combobox</code> element and elements contained in the popup.
				For example, one common convention is that <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> moves focus from the input to the first focusable descendant of the popup element.
				If the popup element supports <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>, in lieu of moving focus, such keyboard mechanisms can control the value of <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> on the <code>combobox</code> element.
				When a descendant of the popup element is active, authors MAY set <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> on the <code>combobox</code> to a value that refers to the active element within the popup while focus remains on the <code>combobox</code> element.
				</p>
				<p>
				User agents MUST expose the value of elements with role <code>combobox</code> to <a>assistive technologies</a>.
				The value of a <code>combobox</code> is represented by one of the following:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If the <code>combobox</code> element is a host language element that provides a value, such as an HTML <code>input</code> element, the value of the combobox is the value of that element.</li>
					<li>Otherwise, the value of the <code>combobox</code> is represented by its descendant elements and can be determined using the same method used to compute the name of a <rref>button</rref> from its descendant content.</li>
				</ul>
				<pre class="example highlight">
          &lt;label for="tag_combo">Tag&lt;/label>
		      &lt;input type="text" id="tag_combo"
            role="combobox" aria-autocomplete="list"
            aria-haspopup="listbox" aria-expanded="true"
            aria-controls="popup_listbox" aria-activedescendant="selected_option"&gt;
				  &lt;ul role="listbox" id="popup_listbox"&gt;
			      &lt;li role="option"&gt;Zebra&lt;/li&gt;
			      &lt;li role="option" id="selected_option"&gt;Zoom&lt;/li&gt;
				  &lt;/ul&gt;
				</pre>
				<p class="ednote" title="Validity changes combobox for ARIA 1.2">
					Please review the following carefully. As a result of these changes a combobox following the ARIA 1.1 combobox specification will no longer conform with the ARIA specification.
				</p>
				<div class="note">
				<p>The structural requirements  for <code>combobox</code> defined by this version of the specification are different from the requirements defined by ARIA 1.0 and ARIA 1.1:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The ARIA 1.0 specification required the input element with the <code>combobox</code> role to be a single-line text field and reference the popup element with <pref>aria-owns</pref> instead of <pref>aria-controls</pref>.</li>
					<li>The ARIA 1.1 specification, which was not broadly supported by assistive technologies, required the <code>combobox</code> to be a non-focusable element with two required owned elements -- a focusable <rref>textbox</rref> and a popup element controlled by the <rref>textbox</rref>.</li>
					<li>The changes introduced in ARIA 1.2 improve interoperability with assistive technologies and enable authors to create presentations of combobox that more closely imitate a native HTML <code>select</code> element.</li>
				</ul>
				</div>
				<p>The features and behaviors of combobox implementations vary widely. Consequently, there are many important authoring considerations. See the <cite><a href="" class="practices"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</a></cite> for additional details on implementing combobox design patterns.</p>

				<div class="role-description">
					<p>A scrollable <rref>list</rref> of <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> where scrolling may cause <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> to be added to or removed from either end of the list.</p>
					<p>A <code>feed</code> enables users of <a>assistive technologies</a> that have a document browse mode, such as  screen readers, to use the browse mode reading cursor to both read and scroll through a stream of rich content that may continue scrolling infinitely by loading more content as the user reads. In a <code>feed</code>, <a>assistive technologies</a> provide a web application with signals of the user's reading cursor movement by moving <a>user agent</a> focus, enabling the application to both add new content and visually position content as the user browses the page. The <code>feed</code> also lets authors inform assistive technologies when additions and removals are occurring so assistive technologies can more reliably update their reading view without disrupting reading or degrading performance.</p>
					<p>For example, a <code>feed</code> could be used to present a stream of news stories where each <rref>article</rref> contains a story with text, links, images, and comments as well as widgets for sharing and commenting. As a screen reader user reads and interacts with each story and moves the screen reader reading cursor from story to story, each story scrolls into view and, as needed, new stories are loaded.</p>
					<p>A <code>feed</code> is a container element whose children have role <rref>article</rref>. When <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> are added or removed from either or both ends of a <code>feed</code>, authors SHOULD set <sref>aria-busy</sref> to <code>true</code> on the <code>feed</code> element before the changes are made and set it to <code>false</code> after the changes are complete. Authors SHOULD avoid inserting or removing <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> in the middle of a <code>feed</code>. These requirements help <a>assistive technologies</a> gracefully respond to changes in the <code>feed</code> content that occur simultaneously with user commands to move the reading cursor within the <code>feed</code>.</p>
					<p>Authors SHOULD make each <rref>article</rref> in a <code>feed</code> focusable and ensure that the application scrolls an <rref>article</rref> into view when <a>user agent</a> focus is set on the <rref>article</rref> or one of its descendant elements. For example, in HTML, each <rref>article</rref> element should have a <code>tabindex</code> value of either <code>-1</code> or <code>0</code>.</p>
					<p> When an <a>assistive technology</a> reading cursor moves from one <rref>article</rref> to another, <a>assistive technologies</a> SHOULD set user agent focus on the <rref>article</rref> that contains the reading cursor. If the reading cursor lands on a focusable element inside the <rref>article</rref>, the assistive technology MAY set focus on that element in lieu of setting focus on the containing <rref>article</rref>.</p>
					<p>Because the ability to scroll to another <rref>article</rref> with an <a>assistive technology</a> reading cursor depends on the presence of another <rref>article</rref> in the page, authors SHOULD attempt to load additional <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> before <a>user agent</a> focus reaches an <rref>article</rref> at either end of the set of <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> that has been loaded. Alternatively, authors MAY include an <rref>article</rref> at either or both ends of the loaded set of <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> that includes an element, such as a <rref>button</rref>, that lets the user request more <rref data-lt="article">articles</rref> to be loaded.</p>
					<p>In addition to providing a brief label, authors MAY apply <pref>aria-describedby</pref> to <rref>article</rref> elements in a <code>feed</code> to suggest to screen readers which elements to speak after the label when users navigate by <rref>article</rref>. Screen readers MAY provide users with a way to quickly scan <code>feed</code> content by speaking both the label and <a>accessible description</a> when navigating by <rref>article</rref>, enabling the user to ignore repetitive or less important elements, such as embedded interaction widgets, that the author has left out of the description.</p>

			<rdef>grid</rdef>
			<div class="role-description">
				<p>A composite <rref>widget</rref> containing a collection of one or more rows with one or more cells where some or all cells in the grid are focusable by using methods of two-dimensional navigation, such as directional arrow keys.</p>
				<p>The <code>grid</code> role does not imply a specific visual, e.g., tabular, presentation. It describes <a>relationships</a> among <a>elements</a>. It may be used for purposes as simple as grouping a collection of checkboxes or navigation links or as complex as creating a full-featured spreadsheet application.</p>
				<p>The cell elements of a <code>grid</code> have role <rref>gridcell</rref>. Authors MAY designate a cell as a row or column header by using either the <rref>rowheader</rref> or <rref>columnheader</rref> <a>role</a> in lieu of the <rref>gridcell</rref> role. Authors MUST ensure elements with role <rref>gridcell</rref>, <rref>columnheader</rref>, or <rref>rowheader</rref> are <a>owned</a> by elements with role <rref>row</rref>, which are in turn owned by an element with role <rref>rowgroup</rref>, or <code>grid</code>.</p>
				<p>To be <a>keyboard accessible</a>, authors SHOULD manage focus of descendants of a <code>grid</code> as described in <a href="#managingfocus">Managing Focus</a>. When a user is navigating the <code>grid</code> content with a keyboard, authors SHOULD set focus as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If a <rref>gridcell</rref> contains a single interactive <rref>widget</rref> that will not consume arrow key presses when it receives focus, such as a <rref>checkbox</rref>, <rref>button</rref>, or <rref>link</rref>, authors MAY set focus on the interactive element contained in that cell. This allows the contained widget to be directly operable.</li>
					<li>Otherwise, authors SHOULD ensure the element that receives focus is a <rref>gridcell</rref>, <rref>rowheader</rref>, or <rref>columnheader</rref> element.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Authors SHOULD provide a mechanism for changing to an interaction or edit mode that allows users to navigate and interact with content contained inside a focusable cell if that focusable cell contains any of the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>a widget that requires arrow keys to operate, e.g., a <rref>combobox</rref> or <rref>radiogroup</rref></li>
					<li>multiple interactive elements</li>
					<li>editable content</li>
				</ul>
				<p>For example, if a cell in a spreadsheet contains a <rref>combobox</rref> or editable text, the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key might be used to activate a cell interaction or editing mode when that cell has focus so the directional arrow keys can be used to operate the contained <rref>combobox</rref> or <rref>textbox</rref>. Depending on the implementation, pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> again, <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Escape</kbd>, or another key may switch the application back to the grid navigation mode.</p>
				<p>Authors MAY use a <rref>gridcell</rref> to display the result of a formula, which could be editable by the user. In a spreadsheet application, for example, a <rref>gridcell</rref> may show a value calculated from a formula until the user activates the <rref>gridcell</rref> for editing when a <rref>textbox</rref> appears in the <rref>gridcell</rref> containing the formula in an editable state.</p>
				<!-- make sure the following para remains synced with its counterpart in #treegrid -->
				 <p>If <pref>aria-readonly</pref> is set on an element with role <code>grid</code>, <a>user agents</a> MUST propagate the value to all <rref>gridcell</rref> elements <a>owned</a> by the <code>grid</code> and expose the value in the accessibility API. An author MAY override the propagated value of <pref>aria-readonly</pref> for an individual <rref>gridcell</rref> element.</p>
				 <p>In a <code>grid</code> that provides cell content editing functions, if the content of a focusable <rref>gridcell</rref> element is not editable, authors MAY set <pref>aria-readonly</pref> to <code>true</code> on the <code>gridcell</code> element. However, the value of <pref>aria-readonly</pref>, whether specified for a <code>grid</code> or individual cells, only indicates whether the content contained in cells is editable. It does not represent availability of functions for navigating or manipulating the <code>grid</code> itself.</p>
				 <p>An unspecified value for <pref>aria-readonly</pref> does not imply that a <code>grid</code> or a <rref>gridcell</rref> contains editable content. For example, if a <code>grid</code> presents a collection of elements that are not editable, such as a collection of <rref>link</rref> elements representing dates in a datepicker, it is not necessary for the author to specify a value for <pref>aria-readonly</pref>.</p>
				<p>Authors MAY indicate that a focusable <rref>gridcell</rref> is selectable as the object of an action with the <sref>aria-selected</sref> attribute. If the <code>grid</code> allows multiple <rref>gridcell</rref>s to be selected, the author SHOULD set <pref>aria-multiselectable</pref> to <code>true</code> on the element with role <code>grid</code>.</p>
				<p>Since <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can augment an element of the host language, a <code>grid</code> can reuse the elements and attributes of a native table, such as an HTML <code>table</code> element. For example, if an author applies the <code>grid</code> role to an HTML <code>table</code> element, the author does not need to apply the <rref>row</rref> and <rref>gridcell</rref> roles to the descendant HTML <code>tr</code> and <code>td</code> elements because the <a>user agent</a> will automatically make the appropriate translations. When the author is reusing a native host language table element and needs a <rref>gridcell</rref> element to span multiple rows or columns, the author SHOULD apply the appropriate host language attributes instead of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <pref>aria-rowspan</pref> or <pref>aria-colspan</pref> properties.</p>
				<p>See the <cite><a href="" class="practices"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</a></cite> for additional details on implementing grid design patterns.</p>

				<p>Content that represents a mathematical expression.</p>
				<p>Content with the role <code>math</code> is intended to be marked up in an accessible format such as <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/">MathML</a></cite> [[MathML3]], or with another type of textual representation such as TeX or LaTeX, which can be converted to an accessible format by native browser implementations or a polyfill library.</p>
				<p>While it is not ideal to use an image of a mathematical expression, there exists a significant amount of legacy content where images are used to represent mathematical expressions. Authors SHOULD ensure that images of math are labeled by text that describes the mathematical expression as it might be spoken.</p>
				<div class="note">
					<p>Browsers that support native implementations of MathML are able to provide a more robust, accessible math experience than can be accomplished with plain text approximations of math. Some rendering engines have close integration with screen readers that allow spacial touch exploration of the formula and refreshable braille display output in the <a>Nemeth Braille</a> format. This level of integration is not supported with images of mathematical formulas, even if the author provides a plain text approximation.</p>
					<p>At the time of this writing, some mainstream browsers do not support MathML natively, and must be retrofit using a JavaScript polyfill library. When authoring math content, use native MathML wherever possible, and test thoroughly. Use a polyfill library or provide a fallback image with a text alternative approximation if necessary.</p>

					<p>The Working Group is still considering implications of the <code>password</code> role:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It might create security or privacy risks that custom password fields without the role would not;</li>
						<li>The use of such fields might not be widespread enough to justify the risks;</li>
						<li>Mitigating risks might require specific assisitve technology support that is not normally specified in ARIA.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The role has been included in this Working Draft to solicit wide review on these questions. The ARIA Working Group particularly seeks input from <strong>security</strong> and <strong>privacy</strong> experts, <strong>assistive technology</strong> developers, and <strong>authors</strong> who potentially would use the role.</p>
					<p>If input suggests excessive risks or insufficient need, the role may be removed from the next publication of this specification.</p>
				</div>
				<p class="warning">The <code>password</code> <a>role</a> does not convey or apply any of the security or privacy considerations found in native password fields. Authors are responsible for making sure that custom password fields have robust security and privacy protection, as befits their use.</p>
				<p>The <code>password</code> <a>role</a> makes it possible for <a>assistive technologies</a> to customize their behavior in order to not inadvertently expose private information. For instance, a screen reader which normally echoes key presses might instead remain silent or echo each displayed character as it is inserted. In order to facilitate the latter behavior, authors SHOULD set the <code>password</code> element's text to characters which obscure the real value, when that value is obscured on screen. Authors SHOULD also update that text each time a character is inserted or deleted by the user.</p>
				<p>In order to ensure that passwords will not be overheard during input, assistive technologies SHOULD NOT echo key presses of printable characters when an element with role <code>password</code> has focus, unless the user has explicitly enabled this option. If the user has enabled key echo, assistive technologies SHOULD present each rendered character as it is inserted rather than speaking a predetermined character, such as &quot;star.&quot; Presenting the rendered characters ensures that all users receive the same information, including notification when the value is being entered into an unobscured <code>password</code> field.</p>
				<p>Authors SHOULD limit the use of the <code>password</code> role to single-line <a>elements</a> which are editable. Authors MAY use the <code>password</code> role on elements which are not currently editable due to application-specific conditions. However, in that instance, authors MUST indicate that the element is read only by setting <pref>aria-readonly</pref> to <code>true</code> or using the appropriate native host language attribute. User agents MUST ignore the <code>password</code> role when it is applied to elements which are neither editable nor explicitly marked as read only. Host languages SHOULD document that the <code>password</code> role can only be used on elements that are editable and not permanently read only.</p>

				<p>For any element with a role of presentation and which is not focusable, the user agent MUST NOT expose the implicit native semantics of the element (the role and its states and properties) to accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interfaces">APIs</abbr>. However, the user agent MUST expose content and descendant elements that do not have an explicit or inherited role of presentation. Thus, the <code>presentation</code> role causes a given element to be treated as having no role or to be removed from the accessibility tree, but does not cause the content contained within the element to be removed from the accessibility tree.</p>
				<p>For example, according to an accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interface">API</abbr>, the following markup elements would appear to have identical role semantics (no role) and identical content.</p>
				<pre class="example highlight"><span class="comment">&lt;!-- 1. [role="presentation"] negates the implicit 'heading' role semantics but does not affect the contents. --&gt;</span>
&lt;h1 role="presentation"&gt; Sample Content &lt;/h1&gt;

<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 2. There is no implicit role for span, so only the contents are exposed. --&gt;</span>
&lt;span&gt; Sample Content &lt;/span&gt;

<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 3. Depending on styling and other factors, this role declaration is redundant in some implementations. --&gt;</span>
&lt;span role="presentation"&gt; Sample Content &lt;/span&gt;

<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 4. In all cases, the element contents are exposed to accessibility APIs without any implied role semantics. --&gt;</span>
<span class="comment">&lt;!-- &lt;&gt; --&gt;</span> Sample Content <span class="comment">&lt;!-- &lt;/&gt; --&gt;</span>
</pre>
				<p>The <code>presentation</code> role is used on an element that has implicit native semantics, meaning that there is a default accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interface">API</abbr> role for the element. Some elements are only complete when additional descendant elements are provided. For example, in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, table elements (matching the <rref>table</rref> role) require <code>tr</code> descendants (the <rref>row</rref> <a>role</a>), which in turn require <code>th</code> or <code>td</code> children (the <rref>cell</rref>, <rref>columnheader</rref>, <rref>rowheader</rref> roles). Similarly, lists require list item children. The descendant elements that complete the semantics of an element are described in <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> as <a href="#mustContain">required owned elements</a>.</p>
				<p>When an explicit or inherited role of <code>presentation</code> is applied to an element with the implicit semantic of a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role that has <a href="#mustContain">required owned elements</a>, in addition to the element with the explicit role of <code>presentation</code>, the user agent MUST apply an inherited role of presentation to any owned elements that do not have an explicit role defined. Also, when an explicit or inherited role of presentation is applied to a host language element which has required children as defined by the host language specification, in addition to the element with the explicit role of presentation, the user agent MUST apply an inherited role of presentation to any required children that do not have an explicit role defined.</p>
				<p>In <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> <a>element</a> is treated as a single entity regardless of the type of image file. Consequently, using <code>role="presentation"</code> or <code>role="none"</code> on an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>img</code> is equivalent to using <code>aria-hidden="true"</code>. In order to make the image contents accessible, authors can embed the object using an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> <a>element</a>, or use inline <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> code, and follow the accessibility guidelines for the image content.</p>
				<p>For any element with an explicit or inherited role of presentation and which is not focusable, user agents MUST ignore role-specific <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties for that element. For example, in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, a <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> element with a role of <code>presentation</code> will have the implicit native semantics of its <code>li</code> elements removed because the <rref>list</rref> role to which the <code>ul</code> or <code>ol</code> corresponds has a <a href="#mustContain">required owned element</a> of <rref>listitem</rref>. Likewise, the implicit native semantics of an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>table</code> element's <code>thead</code>/<code>tbody</code>/<code>tfoot</code>/<code>tr</code>/<code>th</code>/<code>td</code> descendants will also be removed, because the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> specification indicates that these are required structural descendants of the <code>table</code> element.</p>
				<p class="note">Only the implicit native semantics of elements that correspond to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a href="#mustContain">required owned elements</a> are removed. All other content remains intact, including nested tables or lists, unless those elements also have an explicit role of <code>presentation</code> applied.</p>
				<p>For example, according to an accessibility <abbr title="Application Programing Interface">API</abbr>, the following markup elements would appear to have identical role semantics (no roles) and identical content.</p>
				<pre class="example highlight"><span class="comment">&lt;!-- 1. [role="presentation"] negates the implicit 'list' and 'listitem' role semantics but does not affect the contents. --&gt;</span>
&lt;ul role="presentation"&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; More Sample Content &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 2. There is no implicit role for "foo", so only the contents are exposed. --&gt;</span>
&lt;foo&gt;
  &lt;foo&gt; Sample Content &lt;/foo&gt;
  &lt;foo&gt; More Sample Content &lt;/foo&gt;
&lt;/foo&gt;</pre>
				<p class="note">There are other <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles with required children for which this situation is applicable (e.g., radiogroups and listboxes), but tables and lists are the most common real-world cases in which the presentation inheritance is likely to apply.</p>
				<p>For any element with an explicit or inherited role of <code>presentation</code>, user agents MUST apply an inherited role of <code>presentation</code> to all host-language-specific labeling elements for the presentational element. For example, a <code>table</code> element with a role of <code>presentation</code> will have the implicit native semantics of its <code>caption</code> element removed, because the caption is merely a label for the presentational table.</p>
				<p>Authors SHOULD NOT provide meaningful alternative text (for example, use <code>alt=""</code> in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>) when the <code>presentation</code> role is applied to an image.</p>
				<p>In the following code sample, the containing <rref>img</rref> and is appropriately labeled by the caption paragraph. In this example the <code>img</code> element can be marked as presentation because the role and the text alternatives are provided by the containing element.</p>
				<pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="img" aria-labelledby="caption"&gt;
  &lt;img src="example.png" role="presentation" alt=""&gt;
  &lt;p id="caption"&gt;A visible text caption labeling the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
				<p>In the following code sample, because the anchor (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>a</code> element) is acting as the treeitem, the list item (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code>li</code> element) is assigned an explicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role of presentation to override the user agent's implicit native semantics for list items.</p>
				<pre class="example highlight">
&lt;ul role="tree"&gt;
  &lt;li role="presentation"&gt;
	&lt;a role="treeitem" aria-expanded="true"&gt;An expanded tree node&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  …
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>

				<p>There are two types of separators: a static <rref>structure</rref> that provides only a visible boundary and a focusable, interactive <rref>widget</rref> that is also moveable. If a <code>separator</code> is not focusable, it is revealed to <a>assistive technologies</a> as a static structural element. For example, a static <code>separator</code> can be used to help visually divide two groups of menu items in a menu or to provide a horizontal rule between two sections of a page.</p>
				<p>Authors MAY make a <code>separator</code> focusable to create a <rref>widget</rref> that both provides a visible boundary between two sections of content and enables the user to change the relative size of the sections by changing the position of the <code>separator</code>. A variable <code>separator</code> widget can be moved continuously within a range, whereas a fixed <code>separator</code> widget supports only two discrete positions. Typically, a fixed <code>separator</code> widget is used to toggle one of the sections between expanded and collapsed states.</p>
				<p>If the <code>separator</code> is focusable, authors MUST set the value of <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> to a <a href="#valuetype_number">number</a> reflecting the current position of the <code>separator</code> and update that value when it changes. Authors SHOULD also provide the value of <pref>aria-valuemin</pref> if it is not <code>0</code> and the value of <pref>aria-valuemax</pref> if it is not <code>100</code>. If missing or not a number, the implicit values of these attributes are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>The implicit value of <code>aria-valuemin</code> is <code>0</code>.</li>
				    <li>The implicit value of <code>aria-valuemax</code> is <code>100</code>.</li>

				<p>In applications where there is more than one focusable <code>separator</code>, authors SHOULD provide an accessible name for each one.</p>

			<div class="role-description">
				<p>A form of <rref>range</rref> that expects the user to select from among discrete choices.</p>
				<p>A <code>spinbutton</code> typically allows users to change its displayed value by activating increment and decrement buttons that step through a set of allowed values. Some implementations display the value in an text field that allows editing and typing but typically limits input in ways that help prevent invalid values.</p>
				<p>Although a <code>spinbutton</code> is similar in appearance to many presentations of <code>select</code>, it is advisable to use <code>spinbutton</code> when working with known ranges (especially in the case of large ranges) as opposed to distinct options. For example, a <code>spinbutton</code> representing a range from 1 to 1,000,000 would provide much better performance than a <code>select</code> <a>widget</a> representing the same values.</p>
				<p>Authors MAY create a <code>spinbutton</code> with children or owned elements, but MUST limit those elements to a <rref>textbox</rref> and/or two <rref title="button">buttons</rref>. Alternatively, authors MAY apply the <rref>spinbutton</rref> role to a text input and create sibling buttons to support the increment and decrement functions.</p>
				<p>To be <a>keyboard accessible</a>, authors SHOULD manage focus of descendants for all instances of this <a>role</a>, as described in <a href="#managingfocus">Managing Focus</a>. When a <code>spinbutton</code> receives focus, authors SHOULD ensure focus is placed on the <rref>textbox</rref> element if one is present, and on the <code>spinbutton</code> itself otherwise. Authors SHOULD also ensure the <kbd>up</kbd> and <kbd>down</kbd> arrows on a keyboard perform the increment and decrement functions and that the increment and decrement <rref>button</rref> elements are <em>NOT</em> included in the primary navigation ring, e.g., the Tab ring in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
				<p>Authors SHOULD set the <pref>aria-valuenow</pref> attribute when the <rref>spinbutton</rref> has a value. Authors SHOULD set the <pref>aria-valuemin</pref> attribute when there is a minimum value, and the <pref>aria-valuemax</pref> attribute when there is a maximum value.</p>

<!-- FIXME: This is commented out because the ARIA Working Group agreed to move the text role to ARIA 2.0,

				<p>An element whose entire subtree should be exposed to accessibility APIs as plain text.</p>
				<p>The <code>text</code> role allows authors to mark an element and all of its subtree contents as plain text.</p>
				<p>Authors SHOULD NOT use the <code>text</code> role on interactive controls (buttons, links, etc.) or ancestors of those controls, because it could prevent users of assistive technologies from accessing the controls. Authors wishing to retain the semantics of subtree contents could consider the ARIA 1.0 <rref>presentation</rref> or ARIA 1.1 <rref>none</rref> role instead.</p>
				<div class="note">
					<p>As with any ARIA 1.1 role, authors may provide a fallback ARIA 1.0 role.</p>
					<pre class="example highlight">
						&lt;p&gt;I &lt;span role="text img" aria-label="love"&gt;♥︎&lt;/span&gt; New York.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;My &lt;span role="text img" aria-label="heart"&gt;♥︎&lt;/span&gt; bleeds.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;span role="text img" aria-label="3 of 5 stars"&gt;★★★☆☆︎&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
					</pre>
					<p>In a screen reader using an ARIA 1.1-capable browsers, the user would hear "I love New York." In an ARIA 1.0-capable browser, the user might hear "I, love image, New York."</p>
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<p>It is not necessary to use the fallback role if the implicit role for the element provides sufficient fallback. In this example, an ARIA 1.0-capable browser would not recognize the "text" role token, and fall back to the default image role.</p>
					<pre class="example highlight">
						&lt;p&gt;I &lt;img src="icon.gif" alt="love" role="text"&gt; New York.︎&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;p&gt;My &lt;img src="icon.gif" alt="heart" role="text"&gt; bleeds.︎&lt;/p&gt;
					</pre>
				</div>
				<div class="note">
					<p>The text role can also be used to flatten structural semantics without providing an explicit label. The following example would be presented to assistive technologies as one static text element ("I like turtles") rather than three separate paragraphs.</p>
					<pre class="example highlight">
						&lt;div role="text"&gt;
						  &lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;
						  &lt;p&gt;like&lt;/p&gt;
						  &lt;p&gt;turtles&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;
					</pre>
					<p>Use caution when using the text role on structural elements. In particular, avoid using the text role on elements with interactive descendants.</p>
					<pre class="example highlight">
						&lt;p role="text"&gt;
						  &lt;!&dash;&dash; Example of incorrect usage. &dash;&dash;&gt;
						  This &lt;a href="#"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; becomes presentational, so
						  it is no longer a link. The paragraph is just plain text.
						  This is probably not what the author intended.

When user has focus in a single-line <code>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</code> element, the keystroke usually submits the form. When user has focus in a multi-line <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> element, the keystroke inserts a line break. The <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <code>textbox</code> role differentiates these types of boxes with the <pref>aria-multiline</pref> attribute, so authors are advised to be aware of this distinction when designing the field.</p>

		<h2>Clarification of States versus Properties</h2>
		<p>The terms "states" and "properties" refer to similar features. Both provide specific information about an <a>object</a>, and both form part of the definition of the nature of <a>roles</a>. In this document, states and properties are both treated as aria-prefixed markup <a>attributes</a>. However, they are maintained conceptually distinct to clarify subtle differences in their meaning. One major difference is that the <span>values</span> of properties (such as <pref>aria-labelledby</pref>) are often less likely to change throughout the application life-cycle than the values of states (such as <sref>aria-checked</sref>) which may change frequently due to user interaction. Note that the frequency of change difference is not a rule; a few properties, such as <pref>aria-valuetext</pref> are expected to change often. Because the distinction between states and properties is of little consequence to most web content authors, this specification refers to both "states" and "properties" simply as "attributes" whenever possible. See the definitions of <a class="termref" href="#dfn-state">state</a> and <a class="termref" href="#dfn-property">property</a> for more information.</p>

			<h3>Related Concepts</h3>
			<p>Advisory information about features from this or other languages that correspond to this <a>state</a> or <a>property</a>. While the correspondence may not be exact, it is useful to help understand the intent of the state or property.</p>

			<h3>Used in Roles</h3>
			<p>Advisory information about <a href="#role_definitions">roles</a> that use this <a>state</a> or <a>property</a>.

		<section id="propcharacteristic_value">
			<h3>Value</h3>
			<p>Value type of the <a>state</a> or <a>property</a>. The value may be one of the following types:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt id="valuetype_true-false">true/false</dt>
				<dd>Value representing either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The default value for this value type is <code>false</code> unless otherwise specified.</dd>

				<dd>Value representing <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, or <code>undefined</code> (not applicable). The default value for this value type is <code>undefined</code> unless otherwise specified. For example, an element with <sref>aria-expanded</sref> set to <code>false</code> is not currently expanded; an element with <sref>aria-expanded</sref> set to <code>undefined</code> is not expandable.</dd>

				<dt id="valuetype_string">string</dt>
				<dd>Unconstrained value type.</dd>
				<dt id="valuetype_token">token</dt>

		<h2>ARIA Attributes</h2>
		<section id="enumerated-attribute-values">
			<h3>Multi-value Attribute Values</h3>
			<p>When the ARIA attribute definition includes a table listing the attribute's allowed <span>values</span>,
			that attribute is a multi-value nullable attribute.
			Each value in the table is a keyword for the attribute, mapping to a state of the same name. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="idl-reflection-attribute-values">
			<h3>IDL reflection of ARIA attributes</h3>
			<p>All ARIA attributes reflect in IDL as [=nullable type|nullable=] {{DOMString}} attributes.
			This includes the boolean-like <a href="#valuetype_true-false">true/false</a> type, and all other ARIA attributes.</p>
			<p>Default values from the ARIA values tables MUST NOT reflect to IDL as the
			<a data-cite="html/common-microsyntaxes.html#missing-value-default">missing value default</a> or the
			<a data-cite="html/common-microsyntaxes.html#invalid-value-default">invalid value default</a> for the attribute.
			On getting, a missing ARIA attribute will return <code>null</code>. ARIA attributes are not validated on get.
			If an ARIA value is invalid, on getting, it will return its set value as a literal string, and will not return an invalid value default.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="os-aapi-attribute-mapping">
			<h3>Operating System Accessibility API mapping of multi-value ARIA attributes</h3>
			<p>Unlike IDL reflection, operating system accessibility API mappings of ARIA attributes can have defaults.
			Any default values from the ARIA values tables are exposed to the operating system accessibility API as described in
			[[[#supportedState]]], and in [[[CORE-AAM]]].</p>
		</section>
		<section id="enumerated-attribute-values-html">
			<h3>ARIA nullable DOMString Attributes</h3>
			<p>As noted in [[[#typemapping]]], attributes are included in host languages, and the syntax for representation of WAI-ARIA types is governed by the host language.</p>
			<p>The following algorithm should be used for ARIA nullable {{DOMString}} attributes in HTML:</p>
			<p>On getting, if the corresponding content attribute is not present, then the IDL attribute must return null,
			otherwise, the IDL attribute must get the value in a transparent, case-preserving manner.
			On setting, if the new value is null, the content attribute must be removed, and otherwise,
			the content attribute must be set to the specified new value in a transparent, case-preserving manner.</p>
			<p class="note">
			Note: As of ARIA 1.2, all ARIA attributes exposed via IDL are defined as nullable {{DOMStrings}}. This matches the current implementation of all major rendering engines. This specification change should result in no implementation changes; it will merely represent the current reality of web engines.
			However, in a future draft, the ARIA Working Group intends to change several ARIA attributes to non-nullable DOMStrings, and seek implementations. The proposed change will bring ARIA into alignment with the HTML’s usage of <a data-cite="html/common-microsyntaxes.html#enumerated-attribute">enumerated attributes</a>.</p>

				<p>The <code>aria-activedescendant</code> property provides an alternative method of managing focus for interactive elements that may contain multiple focusable descendants, such as menus, grids, and toolbars. Instead of moving DOM focus among <a>owned</a> elements, authors MAY set DOM focus on a container <a>element</a> that supports <code>aria-activedescendant</code> and then use <code>aria-activedescendant</code> to refer to the element that is active.</p>
				<p> Authors MUST ensure that one of the following two sets of conditions is met when setting the value of <code>aria-activedescendant</code> on an element with DOM focus:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The value of <code>aria-activedescendant</code> refers to an <a>owned</a> element. An owned element is either a descendant of the element with DOM focus or a logical descendant as indicated by the <pref>aria-owns</pref> attribute.</li>
					<li>
            The element with DOM focus is a <rref>combobox</rref>, <rref>textbox</rref> or <rref>searchbox</rref> with <pref>aria-controls</pref> referring to an element that supports <code>aria-activedescendant</code>, and the value of <code>aria-activedescendant</code> refers to an owned element of the controlled element.
            For example, in a <rref>combobox</rref>, focus may remain on the <rref>combobox</rref> while the value of <code>aria-activedescendant</code> on the <rref>combobox</rref> element refers to a descendant of a popup <rref>listbox</rref> that is controlled by the <rref>combobox</rref>.
          </li>
				</ol>
				<p> Authors SHOULD also ensure that the currently active descendant is visible and in view (or scrolls into view) when focused.</p>

			<pdef>aria-autocomplete</pdef>
			<div class="property-description">
				<p><a>Indicates</a> whether inputting text could trigger display of one or more predictions of the user's intended value for a <rref>combobox</rref>, <rref>searchbox</rref>, or <rref>textbox</rref> and specifies how predictions would be presented if they were made.</p>
				<p>The <code>aria-autocomplete</code> property describes the type of interaction model a <rref>textbox</rref>, <rref>searchbox</rref>, or <rref>combobox</rref> employs when dynamically helping users complete text input. It distinguishes between two models: the inline model (<code>aria-autocomplete="inline"</code>) that presents a value completion prediction inside the text input and the list model (<code>aria-autocomplete="list"</code>) that presents a collection of possible values in a separate element that pops up adjacent to the text input. It is possible for an input to offer both models at the same time (<code>aria-autocomplete="both"</code>).</p>
				<p>The <code>aria-autocomplete</code> property is limited to describing predictive behaviors of an input element. Authors SHOULD either omit specifying a value for <code>aria-autocomplete</code> or set <code>aria-autocomplete</code> to <code>none</code> if an input element provides one or more input proposals where none of the proposals are dependent on the specific input provided by the user. For instance, a combobox where the value of <code>aria-autocomplete</code> would be <code>none</code> is a search field that displays suggested values by listing the 5 most recently used search terms without any filtering of the list based on the user's input. Elements with a role that supports <code>aria-autocomplete</code> have a default value for <code>aria-autocomplete</code> of <code>none</code>.</p>
				<p>When an inline suggestion is made as a user types in an input, suggested text for completing the value of the field dynamically appears in the field after the input cursor, and the suggested value is accepted as the value of the input if the user performs an action that causes focus to leave the field. When an element has <code>aria-autocomplete</code> set to <code>inline</code> or <code>both</code>, authors SHOULD ensure that the automatically suggested portion of the text is presented as selected text. This enables assistive technologies to distinguish between a user's input and the automatic suggestion and, in the event that the suggestion is not the desired value, enables the user to easily delete the suggestion or replace it by continuing to type.</p>
				<p> If an element has <code>aria-autocomplete</code> set to <code>list</code> or <code>both</code>, authors MUST ensure both of the following conditions are met:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The element has a value specified for <pref>aria-controls</pref> that refers to the element that contains the collection of suggested values.</li>
					<li>The element has a value for <pref>aria-haspopup</pref> that matches the role of the element that contains the collection of suggested values.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Some implementations of the list model require the user to perform an action, such as moving focus to the suggestion with the <kbd>Down Arrow</kbd> or clicking on the suggestion, in order to choose the suggestion. In such implementations, authors MAY manage focus by either using <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> if the collection container supports it or by moving DOM focus to the suggestion. However, other implementations of the list model automatically highlight one suggestion as the selected value that will be accepted when the field loses focus, e.g., when the user presses the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key or clicks on a different field. If an element has <code>aria-autocomplete</code> set to <code>list</code> or <code>both</code>, and if a suggestion is automatically selected as the user provides input, authors MUST ensure all the following conditions are met:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The collection of suggestions is presented in an element with a role that supports <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>.</li>
					<li>The value of <code>aria-activedescendant</code> set on the input field is dynamically adjusted to refer to the element containing the selected suggestion as described in the definition of <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>.</li>
					<li>DOM focus remains on the text input while the suggestions are displayed.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The <code>aria-autocomplete</code> property is not intended to indicate the presence of a completion suggestion, and authors SHOULD NOT dynamically change its value in order to communicate the presence of a suggestion. When an element has <code>aria-autocomplete</code> set to <code>list</code> or <code>both</code>, authors SHOULD use the <sref>aria-expanded</sref> state to communicate whether the element that presents the suggestion collection is displayed.</p>

				</ol>
				<p class="note">Note that <a>Assistive Technologies</a> with braille support can convert the accessible name to Braille. In addition, assistive technologies will be able to customize such braille output according to user preferences. Using only the accessible name, e.g., from content or via <code>aria-label</code> is <strong>almost always</strong> the better user experience and authors are <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> from using <code>aria-braillelabel</code> to replicate <code>aria-label</code>. Instead, <code>aria-braillelabel</code> is meant to be used only if the accessible name cannot provide an adequate braille representation, i.e., when a specialized braille description is very different from a text description converted to Braille. It is very important to note that when using <code>aria-braillelabel</code> authors are solely responsible for localizing the attribute value so that it aligns with the document language.

				</p>
				<p><a>Assistive technologies</a> SHOULD use the value of <code>aria-braillelabel</code> when presenting the accessible name of an element in Braille, but SHOULD NOT change other functionality. For example, an assistive technology that provides aural rendering SHOULD use the accessible name.</p>

				<p>Some <a>assistive technologies</a>, such as screen readers, present the role of an element as part of the user experience. Such assistive technologies typically localize the name of the role, and they may customize it as well.

				<p><a>Indicates</a> the <a>element</a> that represents the current item within a container or set of related elements.</p>
				<p>The <sref>aria-current</sref> <a>attribute</a> is a token type. Any value not included in the list of allowed values SHOULD be treated by <a>assistive technologies</a> as if the value <code>true</code> had been provided. If the attribute is not present or its value is an empty string or <code>undefined</code>, the default value of <code>false</code> applies and the <sref>aria-current</sref> <a>state</a> MUST NOT be exposed by user agents or assistive technologies.</p>
				<p>The <sref>aria-current</sref> attribute is used when an element within a set of related elements is visually styled to indicate it is the current item in the set. For example:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A <code>page</code> token used to indicate a link within a set of pagination links, where the link is visually styled to represent the currently-displayed page.</li>
					<li>A <code>step</code> token used to indicate a link within a step indicator for a step-based process, where the link is visually styled to represent the current step.</li>
					<li>A <code>location</code> token used to indicate the image that is visually highlighted as the current component of a flow chart.</li>
					<li>A <code>date</code> token used to indicate the current date within a calendar.</li>
					<li>A <code>time</code> token used to indicate the current time within a timetable.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Authors SHOULD only mark one element in a set of elements as current with <sref>aria-current</sref>.</p>
				<p>Authors SHOULD NOT use the <sref>aria-current</sref> attribute as a substitute for <sref>aria-selected</sref> in widgets where <sref>aria-selected</sref> has the same meaning. For example, in a <rref>tablist</rref>, <sref>aria-selected</sref> is used on a <rref>tab</rref> to indicate the currently-displayed <rref>tabpanel</rref>.</p>
				<p class="note">In some use cases for widgets that support <sref>aria-selected</sref>, current and selected can have different meanings and can both be used within the same set of elements. For example, <code>aria-current="page"</code> can be used in a navigation <rref>tree</rref> to indicate which page is currently displayed, while <code>aria-selected="true"</code> indicates which page will be displayed if the user activates the <rref>treeitem</rref>. Furthermore, the same tree may support operating on one or more selected pages (treeitems) by way of a context menu containing options such as "delete" and "move."</p>

				<p><a>Identifies</a> the <a>element</a> (or elements) that provide additional information related to the <a>object</a>. See related <pref>aria-describedby</pref>.</p>
				<p>The <code>aria-details</code> property is for referencing elements that provide more detailed information than would normally be provided via <pref>aria-describedby</pref>. The presence of <code>aria-details</code> enables <a>assistive technologies</a> to make users aware of the availability of extended information and navigate to it. Authors SHOULD ensure that elements referenced by <code>aria-details</code> are visible to all users.</p>
				<p>Assistive technologies MAY use the role of elements referenced by the <code>aria-details</code> property to help users understand the types of information associated with the element. Authors MAY convey the type of details associated with an element as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Comment: <code>aria-details</code> refers to an element with role <rref>comment</rref>.</li>
					<li>Definition: <code>aria-details</code> is applied to an element with role <rref>term</rref> and refers to an element with role <rref>definition</rref>.</li>
					<li>Footnote: <code>aria-details</code> refers to an element with role <code>doc-footnote</code>. This role is defined in [[DPUB-ARIA-1.0]].</li>
					<li>Endnote: <code>aria-details</code> refers to an element with role <code>doc-endnote</code>. This role is defined in [[DPUB-ARIA-1.0]].</li>
					<li>Description or general annotation: <code>aria-details</code> refers to an element with any other role.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Unlike elements referenced by <code>aria-describedby</code>, elements referenced by <code>aria-details</code> are not used in the Accessible <a href="#mapping_additional_nd_description" class="accname">Description Computation</a> as defined in the Accessible Name and Description specification. Thus, the content of elements referenced by <code>aria-details</code> are not flattened to a string when presented to assistive technology users. This makes <code>aria-details</code> particularly useful when converting the information to a string would cause a loss of information or make the extended information more difficult to understand.</p>
				<p>The <code>aria-details</code> property supports referring to multiple elements. For example, a paragraph in a document editor may reference multiple comments that are not related to each other. If a user agent relies on an accessibility API that does not support exposing multiple descriptive relations, the user agent SHOULD expose the relationship to the first element referenced by <code>aria-details</code>.</p>
				<p>It is valid for an element to have both <code>aria-details</code> and a description specified with either <code>aria-describedby</code> or <code>aria-description</code>. If a user agent relies on an accessibility API that does not support exposing multiple descriptive relations, and if an element has both <code>aria-details</code> and <rref>aria-describedby</rref>, the user agent SHOULD expose the <code>aria-details</code> relation and the description string computed from the <rref>aria-describedby</rref> relationship.</p>
				<p>A common use for <code>aria-details</code> is in digital publishing where an extended description needs to be conveyed in a book that requires structural markup or the embedding of other technology to provide illustrative content. The following example demonstrates this scenario.</p>
				<pre class="example highlight">
                                &lt;!-- Provision of an extended description --&gt;
                                &lt;img src="pythagorean.jpg" alt="Pythagorean Theorem" aria-details="det"&gt;
                                &lt;details id="det"&gt;
                                  &lt;summary&gt;Example&lt;/summary&gt;
                                  &lt;p&gt;
                                    The Pythagorean Theorem is a relationship in Euclidean Geometry between the three sides of
                                    a right triangle, where the square of the hypotenuse is the sum of the squares of the two
                                    opposing sides.
                                  &lt;/p&gt;
                                  &lt;p&gt;
                                    The following drawing illustrates an application of the Pythagorean Theorem when used to
                                    construct a skateboard ramp.
                                  &lt;/p&gt;
                                  &lt;object data="skatebd-ramp.svg"  type="image/svg+xml"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;
                                  &lt;p&gt;
                                    In this example you will notice a skateboard ramp with a base and vertical board whose width
                                    is the width of the ramp. To compute how long the ramp must be, simply calculate the
                                    base length, square it, sum it with the square of the height of the ramp, and take the
                                    square root of the sum.
                                  &lt;/p&gt;
                                &lt;/details&gt;
				</pre>

				<p><a>Indicates</a> the availability and type of interactive popup element, such as menu or dialog, that can be triggered by an <a>element</a>.</p>
				<p>A popup element usually appears as a block of content that is on top of other content. Authors MUST ensure that the role of the element that serves as the container for the popup content is <rref>menu</rref>, <rref>listbox</rref>, <rref>tree</rref>, <rref>grid</rref>, or <rref>dialog</rref>, and that the value of <code>aria-haspopup</code> matches the role of the popup container.</p>

				<p>The <code>aria-haspopup</code> property is a token type. <a>User agents</a> MUST treat any value of <code>aria-haspopup</code> that is not included in the list of allowed values, including an empty string, as if the value <code>false</code> had been provided.

					If some functional difference is relevant to display to a sighted user by means of a different visual style, that functional difference is usually relevant to convey to users of assistive technology.
					If there is no visual indication that an element will trigger a popup, authors are advised to consider whether use of <code>aria-haspopup</code> is necessary, and avoid using it when it's not.

			<div class="state-description">
				<p><a>Indicates</a> whether the <a>element</a> is exposed to an accessibility API. See related <sref>aria-disabled</sref>.</p>
				<p>User agents determine an element's <a>hidden</a> status based on whether it is rendered, and the rendering is usually controlled by CSS. For example, an element whose <code>display</code> property is set to <code>none</code> is not rendered. An element is considered <a>hidden</a> if it, or any of its ancestors are not rendered or have their <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute value set to <code>true</code>.</p>
				<p>Authors MAY, with caution, use aria-hidden to hide visibly rendered content from assistive technologies <em>only</em> if the act of hiding this content is intended to improve the experience for users of assistive technologies by removing redundant or extraneous content. Authors using aria-hidden to hide visible content from screen readers MUST ensure that identical or equivalent meaning and functionality is exposed to assistive technologies.</p>
				<p class="note">Authors are advised to use extreme caution and consider a wide range of disabilities when hiding visibly rendered content from assistive technologies. For example, a sighted, dexterity-impaired individual may use voice-controlled assistive technologies to access a visual interface. If an author hides visible link text "Go to checkout" and exposes similar, yet non-identical link text "Check out now" to the accessibility API, the user may be unable to access the interface they perceive using voice control. Similar problems may also arise for screen reader users. For example, a sighted telephone support technician may attempt to have the blind screen reader user click the "Go to checkout" link, which they may be unable to find using a type-ahead item search ("Go to…").</p>
				<p class="note">At the time of this writing, <code><sref>aria-hidden</sref>="false"</code> is known to work inconsistently in browsers. As future implementations improve, use caution and test thoroughly before relying on this approach.</p>

			<pdef>aria-keyshortcuts</pdef>
			<div class="property-description">
				<p><a>Defines</a> keyboard shortcuts that an author has implemented to activate or give focus to an element.</p>
				<p>The value of the <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code> attribute is a space-separated list of keyboard shortcuts that can be pressed to activate a command or textbox widget. The keys defined in the shortcuts represent the physical keys pressed and not the actual characters generated. Each keyboard shortcut consists of one or more tokens delimited by the plus sign ("+") representing zero or more modifier keys and exactly one non-modifier key that must be pressed simultaneously to activate the given shortcut.</p>
				<p>Authors MUST specify modifier keys exactly according to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/">UI Events KeyboardEvent key Values</a> spec [[!uievents-key]] - for example, "Alt", "Control", "Shift", "Meta", or "AltGraph". Note that Meta corresponds to the Command key, and Alt to the Option key, on Apple computers.</p>
				<p>The valid names for non-modifier keys are any printable character such as "A", "B", "1", "2", "$", "Plus" for a plus sign, "Space" for the spacebar, or the names of any other non-modifier key specified in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/">UI Events KeyboardEvent key Values</a> spec [[!uievents-key]] - for example, "Enter", "Tab", "ArrowRight", "PageDown", "Escape", or "F1". The use of "Space" for the spacebar is an exception to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-key/">UI Events KeyboardEvent key Values</a> spec [[!uievents-key]] as the space or spacebar key is encoded as <code>'&#160;'</code> and would be treated as a whitespace character.</p>
				<p>Authors MUST ensure modifier keys come first when they are part of a keyboard shortcut. Authors MUST ensure that required non-modifier keys come last when they are part of a shortcut. The order of the modifier keys is not otherwise significant, so "Alt+Shift+T" and "Shift+Alt+T" are equivalent, but "T+Shift+Alt" is not valid because all of the modifier keys don't come first, and "Alt" is not valid because it doesn't include at least one non-modifier key.</p>
				<p>When specifying an alphabetic key, both the uppercase and lowercase variants are considered equivalent: "a" and "A" are the same.</p>
                                <p>When implementing keyboard shortcuts authors should consider the keyboards they intend to support to avoid unintended results. Keyboard designs vary significantly based on the device used and the languages supported. For example, many modifier keys are used in conjunction with other keys to create common punctuation symbols, create number characters, swap keyboard sides on bilingual keyboards to switch languages, and perform a number of other functions.</p>
				<p>For many supported keyboards, authors can prevent conflicts by avoiding keys other than ASCII letters, as number characters and common punctuation often require modifiers. Here, the keyboard shortcut entered does not equate to the key generated. For example, in French keyboard layouts, the number characters are not available until you press the Control key, so a keyboard shortcut defined as "Control+2" would be ambiguous as this is how one would type the "2" character on a French keyboard.</p>
				<p>If the character used is determined by a modifier key, the author MUST specify the actual key used to generate the character, that is generated by the key, and not the resulting character. This convention enables the assistive technology to accurately convey what keys must be used to generate the shortcut. For example, on most U.S. English keyboards, the percent sign "%" can be input by pressing Shift+5. The correct way to specify this shortcut is "Shift+5". It is incorrect to specify "%" or "Shift+%". However, note that on some international keyboards the percent sign may be an unmodified key, in which case "%" and "Shift+%" could be correct on those keyboards.</p>
				<p>If the key that needs to be specified is illegal in the host language or would cause a string to be terminated, authors MUST use the string escaping sequence of the host language to specify it. For example, the double-quote character can be encoded as "Shift+&amp;#39;" in HTML.</p>
				<p>Examples of valid keyboard shortcuts include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>"A"</li>
					<li>"Shift+Space"</li>
					<li>"Control+Alt+."</li>
					<li>"Control+Shift+&amp;#39;"</li>
					<li>"Alt+Shift+P Control+F"</li>
					<li>"Meta+C Meta+Shift+C"</li>
				</ul>
				<p>User agents MUST NOT change keyboard behavior in response to the <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code> attribute. Authors MUST handle scripted keyboard events to process <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code>. The <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code> attribute exposes the existence of these shortcuts so that assistive technologies can communicate this information to users.</p>
				<p>Authors SHOULD provide a way to expose keyboard shortcuts so that all users may discover them, such as through the use of a tooltip. Authors MUST ensure that <code>aria-keyshortcuts</code> applied to disabled elements are unavailable.</p>
				<p>Authors SHOULD avoid implementing shortcut keys that inhibit operating system, user agent, or assistive technology functionality. This requires the author to carefully consider both which keys to assign and the contexts and conditions in which the keys are available to the user. For guidance, see the keyboard shortcuts section of the <cite><a href="" class="practices"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices</a></cite>.</p>

				<p>This can be applied inside trees to tree items, to headings inside a document, to nested grids, nested tablists and to other structural items that may appear inside a container or participate in an ownership hierarchy. The value for <pref>aria-level</pref> is an integer greater than or equal to 1.</p>
				<p>Levels increase with depth. If the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> ancestry does not accurately represent the level, authors SHOULD explicitly define the <pref>aria-level</pref> <a>attribute</a>.</p>
				<p>This attribute is applied to elements that act as leaf nodes within the orientation of the set, for example, on elements with role <rref>treeitem</rref> rather than elements with role <rref>group</rref>. This means that multiple elements in a set may have the same value for this attribute. Although it would be less repetitive to provide a single value on the container, restricting this to leaf nodes ensures that there is a single way for <a>assistive technologies</a> to use the attribute.</p>
				<p>If the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> ancestry accurately represents the level, the <a>user agent</a> can calculate the level of an item from the document structure. This attribute can be used to provide an explicit indication of the level when that is not possible to calculate from the document structure or the <pref>aria-owns</pref> attribute. User agent support for automatic calculation of level may vary; authors SHOULD test with <a>user agents</a> and assistive technologies to determine whether this attribute is needed. If the author intends for the user agent to calculate the level, the author SHOULD omit this attribute.</p>
                <p class="note"> In the case of a <rref>treegrid</rref>, <pref>aria-level</pref> is supported on elements with the role <rref>row</rref>, not elements with role <rref>gridcell</rref>. At first glance, this may seem inconsistent with the application of <pref>aria-level</pref> on <rref>treeitem</rref> elements, but it is consistent in that the <rref>row</rref> acts as the leaf node within the vertical orientation of the <rref>grid</rref>, whereas the <rref>gridcell</rref> is a leaf node within the horizontal orientation of each <rref>row</rref>. Level is not supported on sets of cells within rows, so the <pref>aria-level</pref> attribute is applied to the element with the role <rref>row</rref>.</p>

				<p><a>Indicates</a> that an <a>element</a> will be updated, and describes the types of updates the <a>user agents</a>, <a>assistive technologies</a>, and user can expect from the <a>live region</a>.</p>
				<p>The <span>values</span> of this <a>attribute</a> are expressed in degrees of importance. When regions are specified as <code>polite</code>, assistive technologies will notify users of updates but generally do not interrupt the current task, and updates take low priority. When regions are specified as <code>assertive</code>, assistive technologies will immediately notify the user, and could potentially clear the speech queue of previous updates.</p>
				<p>Politeness levels are essentially an ordering mechanism for updates and serve as a strong suggestion to user agents or assistive technologies. The value may be overridden by user agents, assistive technologies, or the user. For example, if assistive technologies can determine that a change occurred in response to a key press or a mouse click, the assistive technologies may present that change immediately even if the value of the <pref>aria-live</pref> attribute states otherwise.</p>
				<p>Since different users have different needs, it is up to the user to tweak his or her assistive technologies' response to a live region with a certain politeness level from the commonly defined baseline. Assistive technologies may choose to implement increasing and decreasing levels of granularity so that the user can exercise control over queues and interruptions.</p>
				<p>When the <a>property</a> is not set on an <a>object</a> that needs to send updates, the politeness level is the value of the nearest ancestor that sets the <pref>aria-live</pref> attribute.</p>
				<p>The <pref>aria-live</pref> attribute is the primary determination for the order of presentation of changes to live regions. Implementations will also consider the default level of politeness in a <a>role</a> when the <pref>aria-live</pref> attribute is not set in the ancestor chain (e.g., <rref>log</rref> changes are <code>polite</code> by default). Items which are <code>assertive</code> will be presented immediately, followed by <code>polite</code> items. User agents or assistive technologies MAY choose to clear queued changes when an assertive change occurs. (e.g., changes in an assertive region may remove all currently queued changes)</p>
				<p>When live regions are marked as <code>polite</code>, assistive technologies SHOULD announce updates at the next graceful opportunity, such as at the end of speaking the current sentence or when the user pauses typing. When live regions are marked as <code>assertive</code>, assistive technologies SHOULD notify the user immediately. Because an interruption may disorient users or cause them to not complete their current task, authors SHOULD NOT use the assertive value unless the interruption is imperative.</p>

				<p>The <pref>aria-modal</pref> <a>attribute</a> is used to indicate that the presence of a "modal" element precludes usage of other content on the page. For example, when a modal dialog is displayed, it is expected that the user's interaction is limited to the contents of the dialog, until the modal dialog loses focus or is no longer displayed.</p>
				<p>When a modal element is displayed, assistive technologies SHOULD navigate to the element unless focus has explicitly been set elsewhere.

If focus moves to an element outside the modal element, assistive technologies SHOULD NOT limit navigation to the modal element.</p>
				<p>When a modal element is displayed, authors MUST ensure the interface can be controlled using only descendants of the modal element. In other words, if a modal dialog has a close button, the button should be a descendant of the dialog. When a modal element is displayed, authors SHOULD mark all other contents as inert (such as "inert subtrees" in HTML) if the ability to do so exists in the host language.</p>

				<p>The value of the <pref>aria-owns</pref> <a>attribute</a> is a space-separated ID reference list that references one or more elements in the document by ID.

				<p><a>Indicates</a> what notifications the user agent will trigger when the accessibility tree within a live region is modified. See related <pref>aria-atomic</pref>.</p>
				<p>The <a>attribute</a> is represented as a space-separated list of the following <span>values</span>: <code>additions</code>, <code>removals</code>, <code>text</code>; or a single catch-all value <code>all</code>.</p>
				<p>This is used to describe <a>semantically</a> meaningful changes, as opposed to merely presentational ones. For example, nodes that are removed from the top of a log are merely removed for purposes of creating room for other entries, and the removal of them does not have meaning. However, in the case of a buddy list, removal of a buddy name indicates that they are no longer online, and this is a meaningful <a>event</a>. In that case <pref>aria-relevant</pref> will be set to <code>all</code>. When the <pref>aria-relevant</pref> attribute is not provided, the default value, <code>additions text</code>, indicates that text modifications and node additions are relevant, but that node removals are irrelevant.</p>
				<p class="note"><pref>aria-relevant</pref> values of removals or all are to be used sparingly. Assistive technologies only need to be informed of content removal when its removal represents an important change, such as a buddy leaving a chat room.</p>
				<p class="note">Text removals should only be considered relevant if one of the specified values is 'removals' or 'all'. For example, for a text change from 'foo' to 'bar' in a live region with a default <pref>aria-relevant</pref> value, the text addition ('bar') would be spoken, but the text removal ('foo') would not.</p>
				<p><pref>aria-relevant</pref> is an optional attribute of live regions. This is a suggestion to <a>assistive technologies</a>, but assistive technologies are not required to present changes of all the relevant types.</p>
				<p>When <pref>aria-relevant</pref> is not defined, an element's value is inherited from the nearest ancestor with a defined value. Although the value is a <a href="#valuetype_token_list">token list</a>, inherited values are not additive; the value provided on a descendant element completely overrides any inherited value from an ancestor element.</p>
				<p>When text changes are denoted as relevant, user agents MUST monitor any descendant node change that affects the <a href="#textalternativecomputation">accessible name and description computation</a> of the live region as if the accessible name were determined from contents (<a href="#namecalculation">nameFrom: contents</a>). For example, a text change would be triggered if the HTML <code>alt</code> attribute of a contained image changed. However, no change would be triggered if there was a text change to a node outside the live region, even if that node was referenced (via <pref>aria-labelledby</pref>) by an element contained in the live region.</p>

			<div class="property-description">
				<p><a>Defines</a> a human-readable, author-localized description for the <a>role</a> of an <a>element</a>.</p>
				<p>Some <a>assistive technologies</a>, such as screen readers, present the role of an element as part of the user experience. Such assistive technologies typically localize the name of the role, and they may customize it as well. Users of these assistive technologies depend on the presentation of the role name, such as "region," "button," or "slider," for an understanding of the purpose of the element and, if it is a widget, how to interact with it.</p>
				<p>The <code>aria-roledescription</code> property gives authors the ability to override how assistive technologies localize and express the name of a role. Thus inappropriately using <code>aria-roledescription</code> may inhibit users' ability to understand or interact with an element. Authors SHOULD limit use of <code>aria-roledescription</code> to clarifying the purpose of non-interactive container roles like <rref>group</rref> or <rref>region</rref>, or to providing a <em>more specific</em> description of a <rref>widget</rref>.</p>
				<p> When using <code>aria-roledescription</code>, authors SHOULD also ensure that:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The element to which <code>aria-roledescription</code> is applied has a valid <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role or has an implicit WAI-ARIA role semantic.</li>
					<li>The value of <code>aria-roledescription</code> is not empty or does not contain only whitespace characters.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>User agents MUST NOT expose the <code>aria-roledescription</code> property if any of the following conditions exist:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The element to which <code>aria-roledescription</code> is applied has an explicit or implicit WAI-ARIA role where <code>aria-roledescription</code> is <a href="#prohibitedattributes">prohibited</a>.</li>
					<li>The value of <code>aria-roledescription</code> is empty or contains only whitespace characters.</li>
				</ol>
				<p><a>Assistive technologies</a> SHOULD use the value of <code>aria-roledescription</code> when presenting the role of an element, but SHOULD NOT change other functionality based on the role of an element that has a value for <code>aria-roledescription</code>. For example, an assistive technology that provides functions for navigating to the next <rref>region</rref> or <rref>button</rref> SHOULD allow those functions to navigate to regions and buttons that have an <code>aria-roledescription</code>.</p>
				<p>The following two examples show the use of <code>aria-roledescription</code> to indicate that a non-interactive container is a "slide" in a web-based presentation application.</p>
				<pre class="example highlight">&lt;div role="article" aria-roledescription="slide" id="slide" aria-labelledby="slideheading"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="slideheading">Quarterly Report&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;!-- remaining slide contents --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
				<pre class="example highlight">&lt;article aria-roledescription="slide" id="slide" aria-labelledby="slideheading"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="slideheading">Quarterly Report&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;!-- remaining slide contents --&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</pre>
				<p>In the previous examples, a screen reader user may hear "Quarterly Report, slide" rather than the more vague "Quarterly Report, article" or "Quarterly Report, group."</p>

	<p>The <a>roles</a>, <a>state</a>, and <a>properties</a> defined in this specification do not form a complete web language or format. They are intended to be used in the context of a host language. This section discusses how host languages are to implement <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, to ensure that the markup specified here will integrate smoothly and effectively with the host language markup.</p>
	<p>Although markup languages look alike superficially, they do not share language definition infrastructure. To accommodate differences in language-building approaches, the requirements are both general and modularization-specific. While allowing for differences in how the specifications are written, the intent is to maintain consistency in how the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> information looks to authors and how it is manipulated in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> by scripts.</p>
	<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles, states, and properties are implemented as <a>attributes</a> of <a>elements</a>. Roles are applied by placing their names among the tokens appearing in the value of a host-language-provided <code>role</code> attribute. States and properties each get their own attribute, with values as defined for each particular state or property in this specification. The name of the attribute is the aria-prefixed name of the state or property.</p>
	<section id="host_general_role">
		<h2>Role Attribute</h2>
		<p>An implementing host language will provide a <code><dfn id="attr-role" data-dfn-type="element-attr">role</dfn></code> <a>attribute</a> with the following characteristics:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The attribute value MUST allow a [=token list=] as the value;</li>
			<li>The appearance of the name literal of any concrete <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a>role</a> as one of these tokens MUST NOT in and of itself make the attribute value illegal in the host-language syntax; and</li>
			<li>The first name literal of a non-abstract <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role in the list of tokens in the role attribute defines the role according to which the user agent MUST process the element. User Agent processing for roles is defined in the <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite> [[CORE-AAM-1.2]].</li>
		</ul>

	<section id="host_general_attrs">
		<h3>State and Property Attributes</h3>
		<p>An implementing host language MUST allow <a>attributes</a> with the following characteristics:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The attribute name is the name of any state or property identified in the <a href="#states_and_properties">Supported States and Properties</a> section, such as <sref>aria-busy</sref>, <sref>aria-selected</sref>, <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref>, <pref>aria-valuetext</pref>;</li>
			<li>The syntax does <strong>NOT</strong> prevent the attribute from appearing anywhere that it is applicable, as specified in this specification;</li>
			<li>When these attributes appear in a document instance, the attributes will be processed as defined in this specification.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>		Host languages that support <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2006/REC-xml-names-20060816/">XML Namespaces</a></cite> [[XML-NAMES]] <strong>MAY</strong> require that <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attributes be used with a namespace. In this case, the namespace for <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> state and property attributes <strong>MUST</strong> be <code>http://www.w3.org/ns/wai-aria/</code>. To use <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> in host languages that do not explicitly describe support for it, authors <strong>SHOULD</strong> use this namespace as well, if the host language supports namespaces and there is expectation that user agents will recognize the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> namespace. The namespace prefix is not defined by this specification but generally is expected to be &quot;<code>aria</code>&quot;. </p>
		<p class="note">The <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> state and property attributes have a naming convention such that they all begin with the string &quot;<code>aria-</code>&quot;. This is <em>not</em> a namespace prefix, it is a part of the state or property name. Therefore, when using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties with namespace prefixes, the complete attribute name will be like &quot;<code>aria:aria-foo</code>&quot;.</p>
		<p>Some host languages do not use namespaces with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> state and property attributes, either because the host language does not support namespaces or because the designers wish to incorporate <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> into the core feature set. In these host languages, the namespace name for these attributes has no value. The names of these attributes do not have a prefix offset by a colon; in the terms of namespaces they are unprefixed attribute names. The ECMAScript binding of the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> interface <code>getAttributeNS</code> for example, treats an empty string (<code>&quot;&quot;</code>) as representing this condition, so that both <code>getAttribute(&quot;aria-busy&quot;)</code> and <code>getAttributeNS(&quot;&quot;, &quot;aria-busy&quot;)</code> access the same <sref>aria-busy</sref> attribute in the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>.</p>
		<p class="note">According to the requirements of this section, some user agents recognize <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> state and property attributes <em>with</em> namespaces, some <em>without</em> namespaces, and some might recognize both. Authors are advised to be aware of which form is supported for the host language they are using. Unless the host language and supporting user agents explicitly indicate that the namespace is required, authors are advised to use the attribute without namespaces. Even user agents that support namespaces generally do not publish namespaced <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties to accessibility APIs. In particular, current implementations of HTML, including XHTML, do not support this namespace.</p>

	<section id="host_general_focus">
		<h2>Focus Navigation</h2>
		<p>An implementing host language MUST provide support for the author to make all interactive elements focusable, that is, any renderable or event-receiving elements. An implementing host language MUST provide a facility to allow web authors to define whether these focusable, interactive elements appear in the default tab navigation order. The <code>tabindex</code> <a>attribute</a> in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is an example of one implementation.</p>
	</section>
	<section id="implicit_semantics">
		<h2>Implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Semantics</h2>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is designed to provide <a>semantic</a> information about objects when host languages lack native semantics for the object. <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is designed, however, to provide additional semantics for many host languages. Furthermore, host languages over time can evolve and provide new native features that correspond to WAI-ARIA features. Therefore, there are many situations in which <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics are redundant with host language semantics. </p>
		<p>These host language features can be viewed as having &quot;implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics&quot;. User agent processing of features with implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics would be similar to the processing for the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature. The processing might not be identical because of lexical differences between the host language feature and the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature, but generally the user agent would expose the same information to the accessibility API. Features with implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics satisfy <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> structural requirements such as required owned elements, required states and properties, etc. and do not require explicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics to be provided. On elements with implicit WAI-ARIA roles, authors can also use WAI-ARIA states and properties supported by those roles <em>without</em> requiring explicit indication of the WAI-ARIA role.</p>
		<p>For example, if an element with the functionality already exists, such as a checkbox or radio button, use the native semantics of the host language. <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> markup is only intended to be used to enhance the native semantics (e.g., indicating that the element is required with <pref>aria-required</pref>), or to change the semantics to a different purpose from the standard functionality of the element.</p>
		<p>Implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics affect the conflict resolution procedures in the following section, Conflicts with Host Language Semantics. Therefore, implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics need to be defined in a normative specification, such as the host language specification or the <cite><a href="" class="core-mapping">Core Accessibility API Mappings</a></cite>.</p>

		<h2>Conflicts with Host Language Semantics</h2>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles, states, and properties are intended to add <a>semantic</a> information when native host language elements with these semantics are not available, and are generally used on elements that have no native semantics of their own. They can also be used on elements that have similar but non-identical semantics (for example, a nested list could be used to represent a tree structure). This method can be part of a fallback strategy for older browsers that have no <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> implementation, or because native presentation of the repurposed element reduces the amount of style and/or script needed. Except for the cases outlined below, user agents MUST always use the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics to define how it exposes the element to accessibility APIs, rather than using the host language semantics.</p>
		<p>In addition to these normal situations in which <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is expected to override native semantics, there are elements that are inappropriate to override with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. This could be because identical host language semantics exist, so <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is not needed, or because semantics from <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> directly conflict with host language semantics. When a feature in the host language with identical role semantics and values is available, and the author has no compelling reason to avoid using the host language feature, authors SHOULD use the host language features rather than repurpose other elements with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</p>
		<p>Host languages can have features that have implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics corresponding to roles. When a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role is provided, user agents MUST use the semantic of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role for processing, not the native semantic, unless the role requires <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties whose attributes are explicitly forbidden on the native element by the host language. Values for roles do not conflict in the same way as values for states and properties (for example, the HTML 'checked' attribute and the 'aria-checked' attribute could have conflicting values), and authors are expected to have valid reason to provide a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role even on elements that would not normally be repurposed.</p>
		<p>When <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties correspond to host language features that have the same <a href="#implicit_semantics">implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantic</a>, it can be particularly problematic to use the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature. If the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> feature and the host language feature are both provided but their values are not kept in sync, user agents and assistive technologies cannot know which value to use. Therefore, to prevent providing conflicting states and properties to assistive technologies, host languages MUST explicitly declare where the use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attributes on each host language element conflicts with native attributes for that element. When a host language declares a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attribute to be in direct semantic conflict with a native attribute for a given element, user agents MUST ignore the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attribute and instead use the host language attribute with the same implicit semantic.</p>
		<p>Host languages MAY document features that cannot be overridden with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> (these are called "strong native semantics"). These can be features that have implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics, as well as features where the processing would be uncertain if the semantics were changed with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>. Conformance checkers MAY signal an error or warning when a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role is used on elements with strong native semantics, but as described above, user agents MUST still use the value of the semantic of the WAI-ARIA role when exposing the element to accessibility APIs unless the native host language semantic is permanently presentational.</p>
		<p>The opportunity for host languages to create exceptions to the WAI-ARIA override of native features is meant to avoid potential author errors or problems with intrinsic processing of host language features. Author errors could happen when a host language and WAI-ARIA provide similar but not identical features, where it might not be clear how changing one but not the other affects the accessibility API. Intrinsic processing refers to the way a feature is processed, beyond simple rendering and exposure to the Accessibility API, that cannot reasonably be changed in response to an ARIA feature, and would lead to unpredictable results were ARIA allowed. In these situations, there is good reason for host languages to limit the scope of WAI-ARIA. However, this provision does not give blanket permission for host languages to forbid the use of WAI-ARIA simply by documenting, feature by feature, that it may not be used. Host languages should create restrictions on the use of ARIA only when it is critical to effective processing of content.</p>
		<p>Certain ARIA features are critical to building a complete model in the accessibility API. Such features are not expected to conflict with native host language semantics (though they may complement them). Therefore, host languages MUST NOT declare strong native semantics that prevent use of the following ARIA features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><pref>aria-describedby</pref></li>
			<li><pref>aria-description</pref></li>
			<li><pref>aria-label</pref></li>
			<li><pref>aria-labelledby</pref></li>
		</ul>

		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is intended to add <a>semantic</a> information to objects when native host language elements are not available with these semantics. It is generally used on elements that have no native semantics of their own with respect to user interface objects. At times, however, it is used on elements that have similar but not identical semantics to the intended object (for instance, nested list elements might be used to represent a tree structure). This is usually done as part of a fallback strategy, or because native presentation of the repurposed element reduces the amount of style and script the author needs to use. In these cases, the user agent MUST use the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics to define how it exposes the element to accessibility APIs, not the native semantics.</p>

Therefore, user agents MUST ignore <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties when a host language feature with the same implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantic is provided on the same object. </p>
		<p>Although host languages can also have features that have implicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics corresponding to roles, the above rule does not apply to roles. When a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role is provided, user agents MUST use the semantic of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role for processing, not the native semantic.

		<h2>State and Property Attribute Processing</h2>
		<p>State and property attributes are included in host languages, and therefore syntax for representation of their value types is governed by the host language. For each of the value types defined in <a href="#propcharacteristic_value">Value</a>, an appropriate value type from the host language is used. Recommended correspondences between <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> value types and various host language value types are listed in <a href="#typemapping">Mapping <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Value types to languages</a>. This is a non-normative mapping in order to accommodate new host languages supporting <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</p>
		<p>The list value types&#8212;ID reference list and token list&#8212;allow more than one value of the given type to be provided. The values are separated by delimiter characters recognized by the host language for list attributes, such as space characters, commas, etc. Some languages may require a specific, single delimiter, while others may allow various delimiters.</p>
		<p>Global states and properties are supported on any element in the host language. However, authors MUST only use non-global states and properties on elements with a role supporting the state or property; either defined as an explicit <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role, or as defined by the host language implicit WAI-ARIA semantic matching an appropriate WAI-ARIA role. When a role attribute is added to an element, the <a>semantics</a> and behavior of the element, including support for <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> states and properties, are augmented or overridden by the role behavior. User agents <strong>MUST</strong> ignore non-global states and properties used on an element without a role supporting the state or property; either defined as an explicit WAI-ARIA role, or as defined by the host language WAI-ARIA semantic matching an appropriate <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role. For example, the <pref>aria-valuetext</pref> attribute may be used on a <rref>progressbar</rref>.</p>
		<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles have associated states and properties that are qualified as "supported" or "required".  An example of a property <em>supported</em> by the <a class="role-reference" href="#combobox">combobox</a> role is <a class="property-reference" href="#aria-autocomplete">aria-autocomplete</a>.  The property is designated "supported" in this case because a given <code>combobox</code> might or might not implement auto completion.  In contrast, the <code>combobox</code> role <em>requires</em> the <a class="state-reference" href="#aria-expanded">aria-expanded</a> state in order to indicate that it is expandable.  Comboboxes have a controlled popup element, such as a <code>listbox</code>, that is either open or closed.  If the <code>listbox</code> is open, the <code>combobox</code> is in its expanded state; otherwise it is collapsed. </p>
		<p>When <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles are used, <em>supported</em> states and properties that are not present in the DOM are treated according to their default value. Keeping with the <code>combobox</code> example, a missing <code>aria-autocomplete</code> attribute is equivalent to <code>aria-autocomplete=&quot;none&quot;</code>, meaning the <code>combobox</code> does not offer auto completion.  </p>
		<p>However, <em>required</em> states and properties that are absent are an author error. Missing required states and properties are processed as detailed at <a href="#document-handling_author-errors">Handling Author Errors</a>.</p>
		<p>Elements that have implicit WAI-ARIA semantics support the full set of WAI-ARIA states and properties supported by the corresponding role. Therefore, authors MAY omit the role when setting states and properties. The role is only needed when the implicit WAI-ARIA role of the element needs to be changed.</p>
		<p>Sometimes states and properties are present in the DOM but have a zero-length string ("") as their value. Authors MAY specify a zero-length string ("") for any supported (but not required) state or property. User agents SHOULD treat state and property attributes with a value of "" the same as they treat an absent attribute.  For supported states and properties, this corresponds to the default value, but if it is a required attribute, it signals an author error and is processed as detailed at <a href="#document-handling_author-errors">Handling Author Errors</a>. </p>

				<ol>
					<li>Circular references created by relations, such as specifying that two <a>elements</a> own each other. </li>
					<li>Correct usage with regard to <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> tree structure, such as an <a>element</a> being owned by more than one other element.</li>
					<li>Elements with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a>roles</a> correctly implement the  behavior of the specified role. For example, user agents do not verify that an element with a role of <rref>checkbox</rref> actually behaves like a checkbox.</li>
					<li>Elements that do not correctly observe required child / parent role relationships or that appear elsewhere than in their required parent.</li>
					<li>Determining whether <pref>aria-activedescendant</pref> actually points to an <a>owned</a> element of the container widget.</li>
					<li>Determining implicit values of <pref>aria-setsize</pref> and <pref>aria-posinset</pref> when they are specified on some but not all the elements of the set.</li>

				</li>
				</ul>
			<p>If a <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> property contains an unknown or disallowed value, the user agent SHOULD expose to platform <a>accessibility APIs</a> as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When exposing as a platform accessibility API attribute, expose the unknown value &#8212; do not vet it against possible values. </li>
				<li>When exposing as a platform <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> Boolean state:

			<p>User agents MUST NOT expose <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">WAI-ARIA</abbr> attributes that reference unresolved IDs. For example:</p>

		<h3>Presentational Roles Conflict Resolution</h3>
		<p>There are a number of ways presentational role conflicts are resolved.</p>
		<p>User agents MUST NOT expose <a>elements</a> having explicit or inherited presentational role in the accessibility tree, with these exceptions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If an element is focusable, user agents MUST ignore the <code>presentation</code>/<code>none</code> role and expose the element with its implicit role, in order to ensure that the element is <a>operable</a>.</li>
			<li>If a <a href="#mustContain">required owned element</a> has an explicit non-presentational role, user agents MUST ignore an inherited presentational role and expose the element with its explicit role. If the action of exposing the explicit role causes the accessibility tree to be malformed, the expected results are undefined.</li>
			<li>If an element has global WAI-ARIA states or properties, user agents MUST ignore the <code>presentation</code> role and instead expose the element's implicit role. However, if an element has only non-global, role-specific WAI-ARIA states or properties, the element MUST NOT be exposed unless the presentational role is inherited and an explicit non-presentational role is applied.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example, <pref>aria-describedby</pref> is a global attribute and would always be applied; <pref>aria-level</pref> is not a global attribute and would therefore only apply if the element was not in a presentational state.</p>
		<pre class="example highlight">
<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 1. [role="presentation"] is ignored due to the global aria-describedby property. --&gt;</span>
&lt;h1 role="presentation" aria-describedby="comment-1"&gt; Sample Content &lt;/h1&gt;
<span class="comment">&lt;!-- 2. [role="presentation"] negates both the implicit 'heading' and the non-global aria-level. --&gt;</span>

		<p>Interfaces that include <code>ARIAMixin</code> must provide the following algorithms:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><dfn><code>ARIAMixin</code> getter steps</dfn>, which take the host interface instance, IDL attribute name, and content attribute name, and must return a string value; and
			<li><dfn><code>ARIAMixin</code> setter steps</dfn>, which take the host interface instance, IDL attribute name, content attribute name, and string value, and must return nothing.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>For every IDL attribute <var>idlAttribute</var> defined in <code>ARIAMixin</code>, on getting, it must perform the following steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><p>Let <var>contentAttribute</var> be the ARIA content attribute determined by looking up <var>idlAttribute</var> in the ARIA Attribute Correspondence table.</p></li>

			<li><p>Return the result of running the <a><code>ARIAMixin</code> getter steps</a>, given this, <var>idlAttribute</var>, and <var>contentAttribute</var>.</p></li>
		</ol>

		<p>Similarly, on setting, it must perform the following steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li><p>Let <var>contentAttribute</var> be the ARIA content attribute determined by looking up <var>idlAttribute</var> in the ARIA Attribute Correspondence table.</p></li>

			<li><p>Run the <a><code>ARIAMixin</code> setter steps</a>, given this, <var>idlAttribute</var>, <var>contentAttribute</var>, and the given value.</p></li>
		</ol>

		<p class="note">This very general framework is motivated by the desire for different host interfaces, such as <code>Element</code> and <code>ElementInternals</code>, to give these IDL attributes different behaviors. The alternative is requiring each host interface to duplicate the IDL attributes independently, so that they can specify independent behaviors, but that comes with a high risk of them getting out of sync.</p>

		<section class="informative" id="idl_attr_disambiguation">
			<h3>Disambiguation Pattern</h3>
			<p>Though specification authors may make exceptions to this pattern, the following rules were used to disambiguate names and case of the IDL attributes listed above.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Any attribute name referencing concepts that are combinations of two or more words (such as "described by") becomes a camel-cased IDL attribute capitalizing each word boundary. For example, <pref>aria-describedby</pref> becomes <code>ariaDescribedBy</code> with both the D and B capitalized.</li>
				<li>Likewise, any attribute name referencing concepts that can be hyphenated (such as "multi-selectable") becomes a camel-cased IDL attribute capitalizing each hyphenation boundary. For example, the only valid spelling for "multi-selectable" is hyphenated, so <pref>aria-multiselectable</pref> becomes <code>ariaMultiSelectable</code> with both the M and S capitalized.</li>
				<li>When trusted dictionary sources list both hyphenated or non-hyphenated spellings (e.g. "multi-line" and "multiline" are both valid spellings) use the hyphenated version and apply the hyphenation rule above. For example, <pref>aria-multiline</pref> becomes <code>ariaMultiLine</code> with both the M and L capitalized.</li>
				<li>If all trusted dictionary sources list a single spelling of a compound word with no spaces or hyphens, only the first letter of the term is capitalized. For example, neither “place-holder” nor “place holder” are considered valid spellings of the term “placeholder,” so <pref>aria-placeholder</pref> becomes <code>ariaPlaceholder</code> with only the P capitalized.</li>
				<li>There are currently no acronym-based ARIA attributes, but if future attributes include acronym usage, attempt to match existing DOM conventions (e.g. ID becomes Id).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section class="informative" id="idl_attr_exceptions">
			<h3>IDL Attribute Name Notes or Exceptions</h3>
			<p>Any notes or exceptions for specific attribute names will be listed here.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>ariaPosInSet</code>: The <pref>aria-posinset</pref> attribute refers to an item's position in a set (two words: "in set") rather than the "inset" of an item from the beginning of the collection. Therefore the IDL attribute name is <code>ariaPosInSet</code> with the P, I, and second S capitalized, <em>not</em> <code>ariaPosInset</code>.</li>

		<p>For <code>Element</code>:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The <a><code>ARIAMixin</code> getter steps</a> given <var>element</var>, <var>idlAttribute</var>, and <var>contentAttribute</var> are to return the result of the getter algorithm for <var>idlAttribute</var> <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#reflect">reflecting</a> <var>contentAttribute</var> on <var>element</var>.</p></li>

		<h2>Example IDL Attribute Usage</h2>
		<p>The primary purpose of ARIA IDL attribute reflection is to ease JavaScript-based manipulation of values. The following examples demonstrate its usage.</p>

<!-- ReSpec needs these examples to be unindented. -->
<pre>&lt;div id="inaccessibleButton"&gt;

<pre>// Get a reference to the element.
let el = document.getElementById('inaccessibleButton');
el.tabIndex = 0; // Make it focusable.

// Set the role and label.
el.role = "button";
el.ariaLabel = "Edit";

// Get the role and label.
el.role; // Returns "button"
el.ariaLabel; // Returns "Edit"

// These are interchangeable with the more verbose setAttribute and getAttribute methods.
el.setAttribute("role", "button");
el.setAttribute("aria-label", "Edit");
el.getAttribute("role"); // Returns "button"
el.getAttribute("aria-label"); // Returns "Edit"

// Changes via either interface are reflected by the other.

	<h2>Privacy and Security Considerations</h2>
	<p>This specification introduces no new security considerations.</p>
	<p>In accordance with <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#do-not-expose-use-of-assistive-tech">Web Platform Design Principles</a>, this specification provides no programmatic interface to determine if information is being used by Assistive Technologies. However, this specification does allow an author to present different information to users of Assistive Technologies from the information available to users who do not use Assistive Technologies. This is possible using many features of the ARIA specification, just as this is possible using many other parts of the web technology stack. This content disparity could be abused to perform <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/#active-0">active fingerprinting</a> of users of Assistive Technologies.</p>
