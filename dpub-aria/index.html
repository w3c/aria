	<p>Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about widgets, structures and behaviors in order to allow assistive technologies to convey appropriate information to persons with disabilities. This specification defines a [[WAI-ARIA]] module encompassing an ontology of <a data-lt="role">roles</a>, <a data-lt="state">states</a> and <a data-lt="property">properties</a> specific to the digital publishing industry. These semantics are designed to allow an author to convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies and to enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features used by readers. It is expected this will complement [[HTML5]].</p>
	<p>This document is part of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> suite described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Overview</a>.</p>

		<p>This draft is being published to solicit feedback on all aspects of the proposed vocabulary. Feedback from publishers across the publishing spectrum is encouraged, in particular from members of the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF) on whose structural semantics vocabulary this work is based.</p>
		<p>Implementation of this vocabulary in content or user agents is discouraged at this time, as the vocabulary is subject to change depending on the outcome of this initial review.</p>

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a technical specification that defines a common host language semantic accessibility API and framework that enables web browsers to map the accessibility semantics in web content to platform-specific accessibility APIs. This enables web content to be interoperable with platform assistive technologies similar to native platform applications without platform dependencies.</p>
	<p>This specification is a modular extension of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> designed for the digital publishing industry. The goals of this specification include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Expanding [[WAI-ARIA]] to produce structural semantic extensions to accommodate the digital publishing industry.</li> 
		<li>Align with a new governance model for modularization and extensions to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</li> 
		<li>Provide structural semantics extensions that will support both assistive technologies and enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features used by readers.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p>The roles defined in this specification are derived from the <a href="http://www.idpf.org/epub/vocab/structure/">EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary</a>.</p>
	<p>For a more detailed explanation of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> please refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA Introduction</a> and how it applies to Rich Internet Application Accessibility.</p> 
	
	<section id="target-audience">
		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>This specification defines a module of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for digital publishing, including <a data-lt="role">roles</a>, <a data-lt="state">states</a>, <a data-lt="property">properties</a> and values. It impacts several audiences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a data-lt="user agent">User agents</a> that process content containing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features;</li>
			<li><a>Assistive technologies</a> that provide specialized reading experiences to users with disabilities;</li>
			<li>Authors of digital publications;</li>
			<li>Authoring tools that help authors create conforming digital publications; and</li>
			<li>Conformance checkers, that verify appropriate use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and this Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each conformance requirement indicates the audience to which it applies.</p>
		<p>Although this specification is applicable to the above audiences, it is not specifically targeted to, nor is it intended to be the sole source of information for, any of these audiences. In the future, additional documents will be created to assist authors in applying these <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics for the publishing industry and to define how the information in this document is mapped to platform accessibility APIs.</p> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="ua-support">
		<h2>User Agent Support</h2>
		<p>This module builds on the general <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#ua-support">User Agent support princinples</a> defined in [[WAI-ARIA]] by also providing the ability for user agents to enhance the general user interface presented to readers.</p> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="co-evolution">
		<h2>Co-Evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h2>
		<p>The Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module follows the model for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#co-evolution">co-evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages</a> defined in [[WAI-ARIA]]. It is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like [[HTML5]], [[SVG2]] and EPUB, or to be used as an accessibility enhancement technology in other markup-based languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. It clarifies semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of objects, via style and script, that are not yet directly supported by the language of the page, because the invention of new types of objects is faster than standardized support for them appears in web languages.</p>
		<p>It is not appropriate to create objects with style and script when the host language provides a semantic element for that type of objects. While <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can improve the accessibility of these objects, accessibility is best provided by allowing the user agent to handle the object natively. For example, it is not better to use a <rref>heading</rref> role on a <code>div</code> element than it is to use a native heading element, such as an <code>h1</code>.</p>
		<p>It is expected that, over time, host languages will evolve to provide semantics for objects that currently can only be declared with this specification. This is natural and desirable, as one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to help stimulate the emergence of more semantic and accessible markup. When native semantics for a given feature become available, it is appropriate for authors to use the native feature and stop using this module for that feature. Legacy content may continue to use the Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module, however, so the need for user agents to support it remains.</p>
		<p>While specific features of this module may lose importance over time, the general possibility of the Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module to add semantics to web pages or open web based standards, such as EPUB, is expected to be a persistent need. Host languages may not implement all the semantics this module provides, and various host languages may implement different subsets of the features. New types of objects are continually being developed, and one goal of this specification is to provide a way to make such objects accessible, because authoring practices often advance faster than host language standards. In this way, this module and host languages both evolve together but at different rates.</p>
		<p>Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example, SVG expresses the semantics behind production of graphical objects, not of user interface components that those objects may represent. Host languages such as these might, by design, not provide native semantics that map to this specification's features. In these cases, the Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module could be adopted as a long-term approach to add semantic information to these host languages.</p>

		<h2>Authoring Practices</h2>
		<section id="authoring_tools">
			<h3>Authoring Tools</h3>
			<p>Many of the requirements in the definitions of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a data-lt="role">roles</a>, <a data-lt="state">states</a> and <a data-lt="property">properties</a> can be checked automatically during the development process, similar to other quality control processes used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating digital publications, such as EPUB, can compare the semantic structure of Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> to that defined in this specification and notify the author of errors or simply create templates that enforce that structure.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="authoring_testing">
			<h3>Testing Practices and Tools</h3> 
			<p>The accessibility of interactive content cannot be confirmed by static checks alone. Developers of interactive content should test for device-independent access to <a data-lt="widget">widgets</a> and applications, and should verify accessibility <abbr title="application programing interface">API</abbr> access to all content and changes during user interaction.</p>

		<h2>Assistive Technologies</h2>
		<p>Programmatic access to accessibility semantics is essential for assistive technologies. For more information, refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#at_support">Assistive Technologies</a> section in [[WAI-ARIA]].</p>

<section class="normative" id="conformance">

	<p>Normative sections provide requirements that authors, user agents and assistive technologies MUST follow for an implementation to conform to this specification.</p>
	<p>Informative sections provide information useful to understanding the specification. Such sections may contain examples of recommended practice, but it is not required to follow such recommendations in order to conform to this specification.</p>
