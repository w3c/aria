        Enabling users of assistive technologies to find their way through web content requires embedding semantic metadata about web document structural divisions. This is particularly important for
        structural divisions of long-form documents and goes along with embedding semantic metadata about web-application widgets and behaviors for assistive technologies. This specification defines a
        set of WAI-ARIA roles that are specific to helping users of assistive technologies navigate through such long-form documents.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a technical specification that defines a common host language semantic accessibility API and framework that enables web
        browsers to map the accessibility semantics in web content to platform-specific accessibility APIs. This enables web content to be interoperable with platform assistive technologies that are
        similar to native platform applications without platform dependencies.
      </p>

      <p>
        This specification is a modular extension of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> that is designed for the digital publishing industry. This specification
        includes the following goals:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Expand [[WAI-ARIA]] to produce structural semantic extensions to accommodate the digital publishing industry,</li>
        <li>Align with a new governance model for modularization and extensions to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, and</li>
        <li>Provide structural semantics extensions that will both support assistive technologies and enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features used by readers.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The roles defined in this specification are derived from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-ssv/">EPUB Structural Semantics Vocabulary</a>.</p>

      <p>
        For a more detailed explanation of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, see the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria">WAI-ARIA Overview</a> and how it applies to Rich Internet Application Accessibility.

        <h3>Target Audience</h3>

        <p>
          This specification defines a module of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for digital publishing, including the values used to define [=roles=], [=states=],
          and [=ARIA/properties=] of elements. It impacts several audiences:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            [=User agents=] that process content containing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Digital Publishing
            <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features
          </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#dfn-assistive-technology">Assistive technologies</a> that provide specialized reading experiences to users with disabilities</li>
          <li>Authors of digital publications</li>
          <li>Authoring tools that help authors create conforming digital publications</li>
          <li>
            Conformance checkers, that verify appropriate use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and this Digital Publishing
            <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each conformance requirement indicates the audience to which it applies.</p>

        <p>
          Although this specification applies to the above audiences, it is not specifically targeted &mdash; nor is it intended to be the sole source of information for &mdash; any of these
          audiences. In the future, additional documents will be created to assist authors to apply these <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics for use in the
          publishing industry, and to define how the information in this document is mapped to platform accessibility APIs.

        <h3>User Agent Support</h3>

        <p>
          This module builds on the general <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#ua-support">User Agent support</a> principles defined in [[WAI-ARIA]] by also providing the ability for user
          agents to enhance the general user interface presented to readers.

      </section>

      <section id="co-evolution">
        <h3>Co-evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h3>

        <p>
          The Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module follows the model for
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#co-evolution">co-evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages</a> that are defined in
          [[WAI-ARIA]]. It is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like [[HTML]], [[SVG2]] and [[EPUB]], or to be used as an accessibility enhancement technology in other markup-based
          languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. It clarifies semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of objects via style and script that are not yet
          directly supported by the language of the page, because the invention of new types of objects is faster than standardized support for them appears in web languages.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is not appropriate to create objects with style and script when the host language provides a semantic element for those types of objects. While
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can improve the accessibility of these objects, accessibility is best provided by allowing the user agent to handle the
          object natively. For example, it is better to use a native heading element, such as an <code>h1</code>, than it is to use a <rref>heading</rref> role on a <code>div</code> element.
        </p>

        <p>
          over time, it is expected that host languages will evolve to provide semantics for objects that currently can only be declared with this specification. This is natural and desirable, as one
          goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to help stimulate the emergence of more semantic and accessible markup. When native semantics for a given
          feature become available, it is appropriate for authors to use the native feature and stop using this module for that feature. Legacy content can continue to use the Digital Publishing
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module, however, so the need for user agents to support it remains.
        </p>

        <p>
          While specific features of this module could lose importance over time, the general possibility of the Digital Publishing
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module to add semantics to web pages or open web-based standards, such as EPUB, is expected to be a persistent need. Host
          languages might not implement all the semantics this module provides, and various host languages might implement different subsets of the features. New types of objects are continually being
          developed, and one goal of this specification is to provide a way to make such objects accessible, because authoring practices often advance faster than host language standards. In this way,
          this module and host languages both evolve together but at different rates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example, SVG expresses the semantics behind the production of graphical objects, not of the user
          interface components that those objects might represent. Host languages such as these might, by design, not provide native semantics that map to this specification's features. In these
          cases, the Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module could be adopted as a long-term approach to add semantic information to these host
          languages.

          <h4>Authoring Tools</h4>

          <p>
            Many of the requirements in the definitions of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Digital Publishing
            <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> [=roles=], [=states=] and [=ARIA/properties=] can be checked automatically during the development process, similar to
            other quality control processes that are used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating digital publications, such as EPUB, such processes can compare the semantic structure
            of Digital Publishing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> to that defined in this
            specification and notify the author of errors or simply create templates that enforce that structure.

        </section>

        <section id="authoring_testing">
          <h4>Testing Practices and Tools</h4>

          <p>
            The accessibility of interactive content cannot be confirmed by static checks alone. Developers of interactive content need to test for device-independent access to
            <a data-lt="widget">widgets</a> and applications, and verify accessibility <abbr title="application programing interface">API</abbr> access to all content and changes during user
            interaction.

            <p>
              [Deprecated in DPUB-ARIA 1.1] A single reference to an external source in a bibliography. A biblioentry typically provides more detailed information than its reference(s) in the content
              (e.g., full title, author(s), publisher, publication date, etc.).
            </p>

            <p class="note">
              The <code>doc-biblioentry</code> <a>role</a> was designed for use as a list item, but due to clarifications in the WAI-ARIA specification, it is not valid as a child of the
              <rref>list</rref> role. As the <rref>doc-bibliography</rref> role already identifies a section of bibliography entries, authors are instead advised to use the <rref>list</rref> and
              <rref>listitem</rref> roles when native HTML elements cannot be used to structure the entries.

          <div class="role-description">
            <p>A separator denoting the position before which a break occurs between two contiguous pages in a statically paginated version of the content.</p>

            <p>
              Page break locators are also commonly used to provide static markers in purely digital publications (i.e., where no statically paginated equivalent exists). These markers provide
              consistent navigation regardless of differences in font and screen size that can otherwise affect the dynamic pagination of the content.
            </p>

            <p>
              Authors MUST ensure the name of the page break is an end user-consumable page number that identifies the page that is beginning so that assistive technologies can announce the page as
              needed (e.g., in a command to identify the current page).
            </p>

            <p>
              The page break locator MUST precede the content of the page it identifies. If a page includes a header (<rref>doc-pageheader</rref>), the page break locator SHOULD be located before it,
              even if the header includes a visible page number. The page break locator MAY be used with the page number in a page header if the number precedes all other content in the header.
            </p>

            <p>
              When reproducing page break locators from a static page equivalent, it is sometimes the case that words are hyphenated across pages. When this happens, the page break locator SHOULD be
              placed either before or after the word to ensure it does not interfere with text-to-speech playback.
            </p>

            <aside class="example">
              <p>
                The following example shows three equivalent patterns for marking up page breaks in digital publications. Either the <code>aria-label</code> or <code>title</code> attributes can be
                used to assign the accessible name when an explicit page number is not provided.
              </p>

              follows a repeating template that contains (possibly truncated) items such as the document title, current section, author name(s), and page number.
            </p>

            <p>The <code>doc-pagefooter</code> role MUST be used on every instance of the page footer.</p>

            <p>The <code>doc-pagefooter</code> MUST NOT contain the <rref>doc-pagebreak</rref>.</p>

            <p>The <code>doc-pagefooter</code> MUST NOT contain footnotes (<rref>doc-footnote</rref>).</p>

            <p>Assistive technologies MAY allow the user to read the document content continuously without interruption from the page footer.</p>

            <p>A distinctively placed or highlighted quotation from the current content designed to draw attention to a topic or highlight a key point.</p>

            <p>
              Unlike a passage quoted from another source, a pullquote is a direct repetition of text in the current document. As a result, authors MUST ensure that the presentational occurrence is
              hidden from users of assistive technologies (e.g., using the <pref>aria-hidden</pref> attribute).
            </p>

            <p>
              The following example shows the identification of a pullquote that will be presented elsewhere (e.g., via a script). In this case, the pullquote is not hidden as the marked text is not
              presentational.
            </p>

            <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;p>&#8230; I may die, but first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery.
   &lt;span id="pq01" role="doc-pullquote">Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful.&lt;/span>
   I will watch with the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. &#8230; &lt;/p></pre
            >

            <p>The next example shows a pullquote that duplicates the text. This quote is hidden because it is for presentational purposes only.</p>

            <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;p>&#8230; Better habits pave the way to growth, and growth leads to greater happiness.&lt;/p>

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        In accordance with <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#do-not-expose-use-of-assistive-tech">Web Platform Design Principles</a>, this specification provides no programatic
        interface to determine if information is being used by assistive technologies. However, this specificaton does allow an author to present different information to users of assistive
        technologies from the information available to users who do not use assistive technologies. This is possible using many features of the DPUB-ARIA specification, just as this is possible using
        many other parts of the web technology stack. This content disparity could be abused to perform <a data-cite="fingerprinting-guidance#active-0">active fingerprinting</a> of users of assistive
        technologies.
