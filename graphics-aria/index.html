      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a technical specification that provides a framework to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and
        applications. It enables web browsers to map the accessibility semantics in web content to platform-specific accessibility APIs. This enables web content to be interoperable with platform
        assistive technologies, similar to native platform applications, without requiring authors to include platform dependencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification is a modular extension of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]] designed to support graphics. The goals of this specification
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Expanding WAI-ARIA to produce semantic extensions to support structured graphics such as charts, graphs, maps, technical drawings and scientific diagrams. It has applicability to both
          Scalable Vector Graphics as well as HTML 5 Canvas and graphics produced with CSS styling of HTML and other markup languages.
        </li>
        <li>Align with a new governance model for modularization and extensions to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</li>
        <li>Provide structural semantics extensions that will support both assistive technologies and enable semantic navigation, alternative styling, and interactivity support.</li>
        <li>
          Work in harmony with SVG 2 and ARIA 1.1 to get consistent working accessibility infrastructure, on par with <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and HTML 5.2,
          across all the major browsers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This specification defines the core roles that would be used in all structured graphics or diagrams. It establishes the default roles that can be used to describe graphical markup elements
        such as shapes and canvases. In combination with WAI-ARIA attributes to provide alternative text and to indicate relationships between elements, this provides a framework for annotating many
        figures and diagrams. Future work will expand on this framework to enable more detailed annotation of data-rich graphics such as charts or maps.
      </p>

      <section id="target-audience">
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
          This specification defines a module of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for graphics, consisting of graphics-specific element <a data-lt="role">roles</a
          ><!-- , <a data-lt="state">states</a>, <a data-lt="property">properties</a> and values Again, edit as required re states/properties -->. It impacts several audiences:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a data-lt="user agent">User agents</a> that process content containing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and graphics
            <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features;
          </li>
          <li><a>Assistive technologies</a> that provide specialized reading experiences to users with disabilities;</li>
          <li>Authors of web graphics;</li>
          <li>Authoring tools that help authors create conforming graphics; and</li>
          <li>
            Conformance checkers, that verify appropriate use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and this
            <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Graphics module.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each conformance requirement indicates the audience to which it applies.</p>
        <!--p>Although this specification is applicable to the above audiences, it is not specifically targeted to, nor is it intended to be the sole source of information for, any of these audiences. In the future, additional documents will be created to assist authors in applying these <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics for graphics and to define how the information in this document is mapped to platform accessibility APIs.</p-->
      </section>

      <section id="ua-support">
        <h2>User Agent Support</h2>
        <p>
          This module follows the general <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#ua-support">User Agent support principles</a> defined in WAI-ARIA [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]]. The roles defined here do not
          require any change in behavior by user agents other than in the information exposed to the <a>accessibility API</a>. However, the semantics defined here provide the ability for user agents
          to enhance the general user interface presented to readers. For example, a user agent may provide alternative keyboard navigation suitable to a graphical environment, or may allow users to
          extract a copy of a graphic from a larger document.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="co-evolution">
        <h2>Co-Evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h2>
        <p>
          The <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Graphics module follows the model for
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#co-evolution">co-evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages</a> defined in WAI-ARIA
          [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]]. It is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like HTML [[HTML52]], SVG [[SVG2]] and EPUB, or to be used as an accessibility enhancement technology in other
          markup-based languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. WAI-ARIA <a>roles</a> clarify semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of objects, via style
          and script, or use markup languages which describe the visual appearance of a document rather than its meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although markup languages may provide some of these semantics natively, it is expected that there will be a persistent need for the semantics provided by the
          <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Graphics module. Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example,
          SVG expresses the semantics behind production of graphical objects, not of user interface components that those objects may represent. Host languages such as these might, by design, not
          provide native semantics that map to all of this specification's features. In these host languages, the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Graphics module
          could be adopted as a long-term approach to add semantic information.

        <section id="authoring_tools">
          <h3>Authoring Tools</h3>
          <p>
            Many of the requirements in the definitions of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Graphics
            <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a data-lt="role">roles</a>, <a data-lt="state">states</a> and [=ARIA/properties=] can be checked automatically during
            the development process, similar to other quality control processes used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating graphics, these tools can compare the semantic structure of
            Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> to that defined in this specification and notify
            the author of errors or simply create templates that enforce that structure.

          <h3>Testing Practices and Tools</h3>
          <p>
            The accessibility of interactive content cannot be confirmed by static checks alone. Developers of interactive content should test for device-independent access to
            <a data-lt="widget">widgets</a> and applications, and should verify accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> access to all content and changes during user
            interaction.

          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#at_support">Assistive Technologies</a> section in WAI-ARIA [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]].
        </p>
        <p>For the graphics roles in particular, two categories of assistive technology are particularly relevant, but have different needs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Text-based presentations, such as screen readers, braille displays, and text-only displays or printers. These technologies need to replace a complex graphic with semantic text
            descriptions, preserving any meaningful structure and relationships between components.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alternative graphical presentations, such as colour-adjusted displays, screen magnifiers, large print documents, or embossing printers with graphic support. These technologies need to
            distinguish between graphical features which are primarily decorative and those which are essential for conveying the meaning of the content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The role descriptions suggest which features of an element with that role are considered semantically important and should be conveyed to the reader whenever possible.</p>

        The main content of this specification is [=ARIA/normative=} and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as "non-normative" and
        their subsections, diagrams, examples, and notes are [=ARIA/informative=] (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not
        create requirements that impact a conformance claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normative sections provide requirements that <a class="termref">user agents</a> must follow for an implementation to conform to this specification. The keywords MUST,
        MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
        RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in
        <cite><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">Keywords for use in RFCs to indicate requirement levels</a></cite> [[!RFC2119]]. RFC-2119 keywords are formatted in uppercase and
        contained in an element with <code>class="rfc2119"</code>. When the keywords shown above are used, but do not share this format, they do not convey formal information in the RFC 2119 sense,
        and are merely explanatory, i.e., informative. As much as possible, such usages are avoided in this specification.

      <p>Normative sections provide requirements that authors, user agents and assistive technologies MUST follow for an implementation to conform to this specification.</p>
      <p>
        Non-normative (informative) sections provide information useful to understanding the specification. Such sections may contain examples of recommended practice, but it is not required to follow
        such recommendations in order to conform to this specification.

      <h1>Graphics Roles</h1>
      <p>
        This section defines additions to the
        <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>
        <a class="termref">role</a> [=ARIA/taxonomy=] and describes the characteristics and properties of all <a data-lt="role" class="termref">roles</a>. See
        <a href="#roles" class="specref">ARIA Roles</a> for descriptions of the fields provided by this module.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors are given the ability to influence what is presented to assistive technologies and to influence navigation through the use of roles and properties. This includes the ability to mark
        elements as having no semantic importance. With graphics, there are many cases where presenting and navigating every element will make the graphic harder to understand and use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors may mark elements for exclusion from the semantic representation of the document (the accessibility tree) by assigning the role <rref>none</rref> or <rref>presentation</rref>. The
        element with this role should be treated transparently by assistive technologies, as if its children or text content were directly contained by its parent element. In addition, certain roles,
        such as <rref>img</rref> or <rref>graphics-symbol</rref>, when assigned to a parent element, will cause all child DOM structure to be omitted from the accessibility tree. This is indicated by
        the "Children Presentational" value in the role characteristics table. Finally, the native semantics of the graphics language may also default to ignoring DOM structure that does not have
        semantic data attached; for SVG, this is defined in the SVG Accessibility API Mappings specification [[SVG-AAM-1.0]].
      </p>
      <p>
        In all cases, to be considered presentational, an element must not be interactive and must not be assigned any accessible properties or alternative text. A role of <code>none</code> or
        <code>presentation</code> will be ignored for interactive elements or those with WAI-ARIA states and properties.

          <a data-lt="role" class="termref">roles</a> defined in this specification. They would normally be used in combination with other roles defined in WAI-ARIA to annotate graphics within

        <div class="role">
          <rdef>graphics-document</rdef>
          <div class="role-description">
            <p>A type of <rref>document</rref> in which the visual appearance or layout of content conveys meaning.</p>
            <p>
              Similar to other <rref>document</rref> types, the <code>graphics-document</code> role applies to the root element of a region of the page containing related information, where the user's
              primary interaction mode is expected to be browsing the document rather than controlling an application. The element with this role may be the root element of the document file, or of a
              nested structure within it.
            </p>
            <p>The <code>graphics-document</code> may be distinguished from similar roles as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Relative to other documents, a <code>graphics-document</code> is distinguished by the semantic importance of its visual (usually two-dimensional) representation. User agents and
                  assistive technologies SHOULD take this into consideration when supporting navigation of the graphic. Accessibility technologies that re-format or re-style a document SHOULD NOT
                  alter the layout of a <code>graphics-document</code>
                  except in ways that are consistent with the semantic roles and relationships of its content.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Relative to an <rref>img</rref>, a <code>graphics-document</code>
                  is distinguished by the structured nature of its content. Its child elements may have semantic meaning, and may include links or other interactive widgets.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Relative to a <rref>graphics-object</rref>, a <code>graphics-document</code> is self-contained. Its meaning persists when separated from surrounding content. The element with the
                  <code>graphics-document</code> role defines the scope and context for interpretation of the child content.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In general, authors SHOULD use the <code>graphics-document</code> role for structured graphics such as charts, maps, diagrams, technical drawing, blue prints and instructional graphics.
              However, if a single large graphic has discrete regions that may be safely re-arranged without sacrificing meaning, each of those regions SHOULD be a distinct
              <code>graphics-document</code>. An alternative role (such as <rref>figure</rref>) may be used to group them together. One <code>graphics-document</code> may also be nested inside
              another, for example a bar chart that is embedded in a map or a matrix of chart panels should have a role of <code>graphics-document</code>. The nested document provides encapsulation;
              navigation between components of the inner and outer graphics should be explicit.
            </p>
            <div class="note">
              <p>
                To support user agents and assistive technologies based on the ARIA 1.0 specification, authors may wish to include the <rref>document</rref> role as a fallback value, in the form
                <code>role="graphics-document document"</code>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Future specifications may define more specific roles for particular types of graphical documents with special semantic structures. Those more specific roles would be subclasses of
                <code>graphics-document</code>.

FRED: I've added more explanation to the house example,

OK to omit the second example?

        <h2>Other Roles for Graphics</h2>
        <p>The following core ARIA roles, defined in ARIA 1.1 [[WAI-ARIA-1.1]], are also relevant for annotating graphics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <rref>img</rref> (image) defines a single graphic that is perceived as an indivisible whole. Unlike a <rref>graphics-document</rref>, an image cannot have navigable or interactive child
            content. Unlike a <rref>graphics-symbol</rref>, an image may require a detailed text description to fully convey its meaning to non-visual users.
          </li>
          <li>
            <rref>figure</rref> defines a container element for content (including graphics) that is a key part of the containing document but is outside the normal reading stream. A figure will often
            contain one or more elements with the <rref>img</rref> or <rref>graphics-document</rref> roles, but may also contain text captions, credits, or other related content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The following examples demonstrate appropriate use of
          <rref>img</rref>, <rref>figure</rref>, and <rref>graphics-document</rref>
          in a document.
        </p>

          <p>
            Within an HTML 5 document, an inline SVG may sometimes represent an atomic <code>img</code>. If the graphics form part of the natural reading flow of the text, then this role is
            sufficient, as in the first example:
          </p>

          <object type="text/html" data="img/img-role-for-svg.html"></object>
          <pre class="highlight">
&lt;p&gt;A repeating SVG gradient is defined using the
    &lt;code&gt;spreadMethod&lt;/code&gt; attribute.  
    A value of &lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt; causes the color stops
    to repeat in the same order, from beginning to end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;svg class="inline-example" role="img"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;A repeating linear gradient&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;The gradient starts dark, slowly shifting to light, 
        then quickly dark again.  This pattern repeats four
        times left to right, each time brightening across a large
        region and then getting dark within a short space.
    &lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;linearGradient id="repeat" x2="25%" spreadMethod="repeat"&gt;
        &lt;stop offset="0"     stop-color="black" /&gt;
        &lt;stop offset="0.8" stop-color="white" /&gt;
        &lt;stop offset="1"     stop-color="black" /&gt;
    &lt;/linearGradient&gt;
    &lt;rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#repeat)" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
</pre

          <p>The following example provides the same content, but now structured as a figure that may be re-positioned separately from the flow of paragraph text.</p>
          <object type="text/html" data="img/nested-figures.html"></object>
          <pre class="highlight">

            &lt;title&gt;A reflecting linear gradient&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;desc&gt;The gradient again starts dark, slowly shifting to light, 
              then quickly dark again.  However, the next repeat shifts
              quickly to the light, then slowly back dark.  
              The original pattern is then repeated, followed by the reflected
              version again.
            &lt;/desc&gt;
        &lt;/rect&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;

            Finally, the last version uses a <rref>graphics-document</rref> to include complex annotations on the graphic, which is still contained within a figure element. The two sections of the
            graphic are <rref>graphics-object</rref> elements, while the annotations have individual labels and descriptions.

        &lt;title&gt;Repeating versus reflecting linear gradients&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;desc&gt;
            The graphic shows two gradient patterns,
            annotated with text labels and arrows.
            Both gradients use the same series of color stops,
            starting dark, slowly shifting to light, 
            then quickly dark again.
            This cycle covers one-quarter of the width of the graphic,
            starting on the left.
            The two gradients differ in their repeat cycles.
        &lt;/desc&gt;

            &lt;desc&gt;
                The gradient stretches across the bottom half of 
                the graphic.
                Each cycle of the gradient alternates direction,
                left-to-right then right-to-left,
                as do the arrows that emphasize the pattern.

      <p>
        WAI-ARIA provides a collection of accessibility state and properties which are used to support platform accessibility APIs on various operating system platforms. Assistive technologies may
        access this information through an exposed user agent DOM or through a mapping to the platform accessibility API. When combined with roles, the user agent can supply the assistive technologies
        with user interface information to convey to the user at any time. Changes in states or properties will result in a notification to assistive technologies, which could alert the user that a
        change has occurred.
