	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a technical specification that defines a common host language semantic accessibility API and framework that enables web browsers to map the accessibility semantics in web content to platform-specific accessibility APIs. This enables web content to be interoperable with platform assistive technologies similar to native platform applications without platform dependencies.</p>
	<p>This specification is a modular extension of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> designed to support graphics. The goals of this specification include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Expanding [[!WAI-ARIA]] to produce structural semantic extensions to support graphics such as charts, graphs, maps, technical drawings and scientific diagrams. It has applicability to both Scalable Vector Graphics as well as HTML5 Canvas.</li> 
		<li>Align with a new governance model for modularization and extensions to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</li> 
		<li>Provide structural semantics extensions that will support both assistive technologies and enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features used by readers.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p>For a more detailed explanation of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> please refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA Introduction</a> and how it applies to Rich Internet Application Accessibility.</p> 
	
	<section id="target-audience">
		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>This specification defines a module of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for graphics, including <a title="role">roles</a>, <a title="state">states</a>, <a title="property">properties</a> and values. It impacts several audiences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a title="user agent">User agents</a> that process content containing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and graphics (SVG) <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features;</li>
			<li><a>Assistive technologies</a> that provide specialized reading experiences to users with disabilities;</li>
			<li>Authors of web graphics (SVG);</li>
			<li>Authoring tools that help authors create conforming graphics; and</li>
			<li>Conformance checkers, that verify appropriate use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and this Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each conformance requirement indicates the audience to which it applies.</p>
		<!--p>Although this specification is applicable to the above audiences, it is not specifically targeted to, nor is it intended to be the sole source of information for, any of these audiences. In the future, additional documents will be created to assist authors in applying these <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics for graphics and to define how the information in this document is mapped to platform accessibility APIs.</p--> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="ua-support">
		<h2>User Agent Support</h2>
		<p>This module builds on the general <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#ua-support">User Agent support principles</a> defined in [[!WAI-ARIA]] by also providing the ability for user agents to enhance the general user interface presented to readers.</p> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="co-evolution">
		<h2>Co-Evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h2>
		<p>The Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module follows the model for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#co-evolution">co-evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages</a> defined in [[!WAI-ARIA]]. It is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like [[HTML5]], [[!SVG2]] and EPUB, or to be used as an accessibility enhancement technology in other markup-based languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. It clarifies semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of objects, via style and script, that are not yet directly supported by the language of the page, because the invention of new types of objects is faster than standardized support for them appears in web languages.</p>
		<p>It is not appropriate to create objects with style and script when the host language provides a semantic element for that type of objects. While <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can improve the accessibility of these objects, accessibility is best provided by allowing the user agent to handle the object natively. For example, it is not better to use a <rref>heading</rref> role on a <code>div</code> element than it is to use a native heading element, such as an <code>h1</code>.</p>
		<p>It is expected that, over time, host languages will evolve to provide semantics for objects that currently can only be declared with this specification. This is natural and desirable, as one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to help stimulate the emergence of more semantic and accessible markup. When native semantics for a given feature become available, it is appropriate for authors to use the native feature and stop using this module for that feature. Legacy content may continue to use the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module, however, so the need for user agents to support it remains.</p>
		<p>While specific features of this module may lose importance over time, the general possibility of the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module to add semantics to web graphics or open web based standards, is expected to be a persistent need. Host languages may not implement all the semantics this module provides, and various host languages may implement different subsets of the features. New types of objects are continually being developed, and one goal of this specification is to provide a way to make such objects accessible, because authoring practices often advance faster than host language standards. In this way, this module and host languages both evolve together but at different rates.</p>
		<p>Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example, SVG expresses the semantics behind production of graphical objects, not of user interface components that those objects may represent. Host languages such as these might, by design, not provide native semantics that map to this specification's features. In these cases, the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module could be adopted as a long-term approach to add semantic information to these host languages.</p>

		<h2>Authoring Practices</h2>
		<section id="authoring_tools">
			<h3>Authoring Tools</h3>
			<p>Many of the requirements in the definitions of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a title="role">roles</a>, <a title="state">states</a> and <a title="property">properties</a> can be checked automatically during the development process, similar to other quality control processes used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating graphics, can compare the semantic structure of Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> to that defined in this specification and notify the author of errors or simply create templates that enforce that structure.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="authoring_testing">
			<h3>Testing Practices and Tools</h3> 
			<p>The accessibility of interactive content cannot be confirmed by static checks alone. Developers of interactive content should test for device-independent access to <a title="widget">widgets</a> and applications, and should verify accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> access to all content and changes during user interaction.</p>

		<h2>Assistive Technologies</h2>
		<p>Programmatic access to accessibility semantics is essential for assistive technologies. For more information, refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#at_support">Assistive Technologies</a> section in [[!WAI-ARIA]].</p>

<section class="normative" id="conformance">
	<p>This specification indicates whether a section is <a>normative</a> or <a>informative</a>. Classifying a section as normative or informative applies to the entire section. A statement "This section is normative" or "This section is informative" applies to all sub-sections of that section.</p>
	<p>Normative sections provide requirements that authors, user agents and assistive technologies MUST follow for an implementation to conform to this specification.</p>
	<p>Informative sections provide information useful to understanding the specification. Such sections may contain examples of recommended practice, but it is not required to follow such recommendations in order to conform to this specification.</p>

	<h1>Graphics Roles</h1>    
	<p>
      This section defines additions to the 
      <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 
      <a>role</a> <a>taxonomy</a> 
      and describes the characteristics and properties of all <a title="role">roles</a>. 
      See <a href="aria.html#roles">ARIA Roles</a> for descriptions 
      of the fields provided by this module.
	</p>
	 <p>Authors are given the ability to influence what is presented to assistive technologies and to influence navigation through
      the use of roles and properties. With graphics, there are many cases where presenting and navigating every element will make the 
      graphic harder to understand and use. Authors may mark elements for non-visual exclusion by assigning the role <rref>none</rref>. Graphics also 
      have situations where the author intent is ambiguous and the use of the property <pref>aria-type</pref> should be used to clarify the situation. </p>
      <p>If an author does not want a user agent to non-visually present an element and does not want the
      element included in navigaion then the element should be given a role of <rref>none</rref>. For example, in the case
      an author does not want a chart's axis minor tick marks (tick lines without labels between tick marks with labels)
      presented to assistive technologies since the minor tick marks would add significant noise without increasing comprehension, then the
      author should assign the minor tick marks the role of <rref>none</rref>.</p>
     
      <p>User agents are expected to use the <pref>aria-gtype</pref> property 
           for differentiating between graph features. Two elements with the
             same role and the same semanatic parent and both elements having either no <pref>aria-gtype</pref> or the same <pref>aria-gtype</pref>
              are defined as being part of the same feature.
            Two elements with a the same role and the same semanatic parent but differing <pref>aria-gtype</pref>
            are defined as being two separate features.

        provided to authors so they can convey and control how user agents perceive axes given the author may need to present mulitple y
        axis on opposite sides of the chart (ie left axis in inches, right axis in cm), clustered sets of axes, 3 or more dimension axes and aligned
        axes shared by two charts in the same visualization.</p>

            A graphics document contains complex content 
            that a user should be able to explore.  
            Similar to <rref>document</rref>, 
            the graphical document may contain interactive widgets, 
            but is not itself interactive.  
            User agents may intercept user input 
            for the purposes of navigation.  
            A graphics document is distinct from other documents
            in that the visual layout of the content has semantic meaning. 
            Navigation methods may take this into consideration.
        <p>
        <p>
            Accessibility technologies that re-format a document 
            should avoid altering the layout of a graphical document.  
            For this reason, authors should limit the graphical document role 
            to regions for which layout has semantic meaning.  
            A collection of distinct graphics that can be re-arranged 
            without losing meaning 
            could instead be described as a <rref>graphics-figure</rref> 
            or a <rref>group</rref>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future specifications are expected to define 
            sub-classes of this role 
            for particular types of graphical documents, 
            such as charts or maps.

			<rdef>graphics-figure</rdef>
			<div class="role-description">
        <p>
            A distinct perceivable <rref>section</rref> of the page, 
            that contributes essential meaning to the main page content, 
            but is not part of a continuous stream of surrounding text.  
            A graphics-figure can be shifted within the layout of the document 
            without disruption, 
            but it cannot be removed without losing meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
            A figure often has a visible caption.
            It may be referenced from the surrounding text 
            using a hyperlink or a numbered label.  
            Figures will often contain graphical content. 
            However, other content types 
            with a similar position in the document structure, 
            such as labelled code samples or audio elements,
            would also be figures.  
            Figures may be nested, 
            if the nested figures are also likely 
            to be referenced as discrete units within the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The semantics of this role are intended to mirror 
            the native semantics of the 
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> 
            element in [[HTML5]].  
            It is expected that future versions of HTML 
            will make this the default semantic role for that element.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            To support user agents and assistive technologies 
            based on the ARIA 1.0 specification, 
            authors may wish to include the <rref>region</rref> role 
            as a fallback value,

			<div class="role-description">
				<p>
            The definitive role definition for img is <rref>img</rref>. 
        </p>  
				<p>The use of <rref>img</rref> in the graphics context is slightly different
            than that used outside of it due to the semantics available for drawings.   
            An <code>img</code> can contain 
            multiple drawing <a title="object">objects</a> or image files 
            that when viewed together give the impression of a single image.  
            However, an <code>img</code> represents an indivisible component 
            within a document for navigation purposes.  
            If the child elements are arranged 
            in a semantically rich structure 
            that users may wish to navigate through, 
            authors should use a <rref>graphics-figure</rref> 
            or <rref>graphics-doc</rref> role instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            The element with the <code>img</code> role 
            may also contain captions and descriptive text within child elements, 
            if those elements participate in 
            the accessible name or description calculation for that element.  
            To ensure that elements with a <a>role</a> of <code>img</code> 
            are <a>perceivable</a>, 
            authors MUST provide alternative text or a label 
            determined by the <a href="#namecalculation">accessible name calculation</a>.  
            Authors SHOULD also provide an accessible description 
            that conveys the complete meaning of the image.  
            If the image is purely symbolic, 
            and the visual details are not relevant, 
            the <rref>graphics-symbol</rref> role is more appropriate.
            If the image is used as a direct substitute 
            for a short word or phrase within a sentence, 
            the <rref>text</rref> role is appropriate.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            The <code>img</code> role was first defined in ARIA 1.0.  
            This specification modifies that definition 
            in a backwards-compatible way, 
            to clarify the distinction between images 
            and other graphical roles.

&lt;p&gt;A repeating SVG gradient is defined using the
    &lt;code&gt;spreadMethod&lt;/code&gt; attribute.  
    A value of &lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt; causes the color stops
    to repeat in the same order, from beginning to end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;svg class="inline-example" role="img"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;A repeating linear gradient&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;The gradient starts dark, slowly shifting to light, 
        then quickly dark again.  This pattern repeats four
        times left to right, each time brightening across a large
        region and then getting dark within a short space.
    &lt;/desc&gt;

	<h1>States and Properties</h1>
	<p>WAI-ARIA provides a collection of accessibility state and properties which are used to support platform accessibility APIs on various 
	operating system platforms. Assistive technologies may access this information through an exposed user agent DOM or through a mapping 
	to the platform accessibility API. When combined with roles, the user agent can supply the assistive technologies with user interface 
	information to convey to the user at any time. Changes in states or properties will result in a notification to assistive technologies, 
	which could alert the user that a change has occurred.</p>
	<p>Assistive technology may use <pref>aria-gtype</pref> as an adjective for the role in name calculation.</p>
	<section id="manageing-navigation">
	<h2>Managing navigation</h2>
	<p>Roles, states and properties can be used to manage graphics navigation. Properties can be used to manage navigation behavior and
	differentiate between graphics features with the same role and same semantic parent. Customized navigation behavior may be needed when 
	statistics produce multiple data columns. For example, data for a box and whisker plot are produced by statistics, and 
	the statistic produces columns for the fence, box, median and outliers. Outliers can be classified in more than one way and 
	different statistics can produce different flavors of boxes and fences and outliers. The semantics of the statistic need to be accurately 
	communicated to the user during exploration. Charts, instructional diagrams, chemical models and maps are examples of graphics that
	may need customizable navigation.
	</p>
	<p>The following properties can modify navigation behavior:
	<ul>
	<li><pref>aria-gtype</pref></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="ednote">
	It has not been decided what mechanism, if any, will cue navigation changes.
