# Specification 'svg-aam'

This is the repository for SVG Accessibility API Mappings (svg-aam).  It is the basis of the [Editor's Draft version of the specification](https://w3c.github.io/svg-aam/).

You can also compare against [the most recent published version](https://www.w3.org/TR/svg-aam-1.0/).

This specification is part of the [ARIA suite](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/deliverables), and uses the same code structure and build tools as other ARIA suites. General information about editing specifications is in the [main ARIA repository readme](https://github.com/w3c/aria/).

Publication of the specification is now the responsibility of the SVG working group.  The best way to comment on the specification is by filing an issue in this repository.
