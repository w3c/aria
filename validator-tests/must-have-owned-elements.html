    RULE: "There may be times that required owned elements are missing,
    * for example, while editing or while loading a data set. When a widget is
    * missing required owned elements due to script execution or loading,
    * authors MUST mark a containing element with aria-busy equal to true. For
    * example, until a page is fully initialized and complete, an author could
    * mark the document element as busy."
