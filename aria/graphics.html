	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a technical specification that defines a common host language semantic accessibility API and framework that enables web browsers to map the accessibility semantics in web content to platform-specific accessibility APIs. This enables web content to be interoperable with platform assistive technologies similar to native platform applications without platform dependencies.</p>
	<p>This specification is a modular extension of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> designed to support graphics. The goals of this specification include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Expanding [[!WAI-ARIA]] to produce structural semantic extensions to support graphics such as charts, graphs, maps, technical drawings and scientific diagrams. It has applicability to both Scalable Vector Graphics as well as HTML5 Canvas.</li> 
		<li>Align with a new governance model for modularization and extensions to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</li> 
		<li>Provide structural semantics extensions that will support both assistive technologies and enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features used by readers.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p>For a more detailed explanation of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> please refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA Introduction</a> and how it applies to Rich Internet Application Accessibility.</p> 
	
	<section id="target-audience">
		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>This specification defines a module of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for graphics, including <a title="role">roles</a>, <a title="state">states</a>, <a title="property">properties</a> and values. It impacts several audiences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a title="user agent">User agents</a> that process content containing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and graphics (SVG) <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features;</li>
			<li><a>Assistive technologies</a> that provide specialized reading experiences to users with disabilities;</li>
			<li>Authors of web graphics (SVG);</li>
			<li>Authoring tools that help authors create conforming graphics; and</li>
			<li>Conformance checkers, that verify appropriate use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and this Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each conformance requirement indicates the audience to which it applies.</p>
		<!--p>Although this specification is applicable to the above audiences, it is not specifically targeted to, nor is it intended to be the sole source of information for, any of these audiences. In the future, additional documents will be created to assist authors in applying these <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics for graphics and to define how the information in this document is mapped to platform accessibility APIs.</p--> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="ua-support">
		<h2>User Agent Support</h2>
		<p>This module builds on the general <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#ua-support">User Agent support principles</a> defined in [[!WAI-ARIA]] by also providing the ability for user agents to enhance the general user interface presented to readers.</p> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="co-evolution">
		<h2>Co-Evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h2>
		<p>The Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module follows the model for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#co-evolution">co-evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages</a> defined in [[!WAI-ARIA]]. It is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like [[HTML5]], [[!SVG2]] and EPUB, or to be used as an accessibility enhancement technology in other markup-based languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. It clarifies semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of objects, via style and script, that are not yet directly supported by the language of the page, because the invention of new types of objects is faster than standardized support for them appears in web languages.</p>
		<p>It is not appropriate to create objects with style and script when the host language provides a semantic element for that type of objects. While <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can improve the accessibility of these objects, accessibility is best provided by allowing the user agent to handle the object natively. For example, it is not better to use a <rref>heading</rref> role on a <code>div</code> element than it is to use a native heading element, such as an <code>h1</code>.</p>
		<p>It is expected that, over time, host languages will evolve to provide semantics for objects that currently can only be declared with this specification. This is natural and desirable, as one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to help stimulate the emergence of more semantic and accessible markup. When native semantics for a given feature become available, it is appropriate for authors to use the native feature and stop using this module for that feature. Legacy content may continue to use the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module, however, so the need for user agents to support it remains.</p>
		<p>While specific features of this module may lose importance over time, the general possibility of the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module to add semantics to web graphics or open web based standards, is expected to be a persistent need. Host languages may not implement all the semantics this module provides, and various host languages may implement different subsets of the features. New types of objects are continually being developed, and one goal of this specification is to provide a way to make such objects accessible, because authoring practices often advance faster than host language standards. In this way, this module and host languages both evolve together but at different rates.</p>
		<p>Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example, SVG expresses the semantics behind production of graphical objects, not of user interface components that those objects may represent. Host languages such as these might, by design, not provide native semantics that map to this specification's features. In these cases, the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module could be adopted as a long-term approach to add semantic information to these host languages.</p>

		<h2>Authoring Practices</h2>
		<section id="authoring_tools">
			<h3>Authoring Tools</h3>
			<p>Many of the requirements in the definitions of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a title="role">roles</a>, <a title="state">states</a> and <a title="property">properties</a> can be checked automatically during the development process, similar to other quality control processes used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating graphics, can compare the semantic structure of Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> to that defined in this specification and notify the author of errors or simply create templates that enforce that structure.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="authoring_testing">
			<h3>Testing Practices and Tools</h3> 
			<p>The accessibility of interactive content cannot be confirmed by static checks alone. Developers of interactive content should test for device-independent access to <a title="widget">widgets</a> and applications, and should verify accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> access to all content and changes during user interaction.</p>

		<h2>Assistive Technologies</h2>
		<p>Programmatic access to accessibility semantics is essential for assistive technologies. For more information, refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#at_support">Assistive Technologies</a> section in [[!WAI-ARIA]].</p>

<section class="normative" id="conformance">
	<p>This specification indicates whether a section is <a>normative</a> or <a>informative</a>. Classifying a section as normative or informative applies to the entire section. A statement "This section is normative" or "This section is informative" applies to all sub-sections of that section.</p>
	<p>Normative sections provide requirements that authors, user agents and assistive technologies MUST follow for an implementation to conform to this specification.</p>
	<p>Informative sections provide information useful to understanding the specification. Such sections may contain examples of recommended practice, but it is not required to follow such recommendations in order to conform to this specification.</p>

	<h1>Graphics Roles</h1>    
	<p>
      This section defines additions to the 
      <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 
      <a>role</a> <a>taxonomy</a> 
      and describes the characteristics and properties of all <a title="role">roles</a>. 
      See <a href="aria.html#roles">ARIA Roles</a> for descriptions 
      of the fields provided by this module.
	</p>
	 <p>Authors are given the ability to influence what is presented to assistive technologies and to influence navigation through
      the use of roles and properties. With graphics, there are many cases where presenting and navigating every element will make the 
      graphic harder to understand and use. Authors may mark elements for non-visual exclusion by assigning the role <rref>none</rref>. </p>
      <p>If an author does not want a user agent to non-visually present an element and does not want the
      element included in navigaion then the element should be given a role of <rref>none</rref>. For example, in the case
      an author does not want a chart's axis minor tick marks (tick lines without labels between tick marks with labels)
      presented to assistive technologies since the minor tick marks would add significant noise without increasing comprehension, then the
      author should assign the minor tick marks the role of <rref>none</rref>.</p>

		<h2>Definition of Roles</h2>

        Below is an alphabetical list of the
        <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 
        <a title="role">roles</a> defined in this specification.  
        They would normally be used in combination with other roles 
        defined in [[WAI-ARIA]] 
        to annotate graphics within documents and rich internet applications.

             <p>
            A <code>graphics-doc</code> inherits from <rref>document</rref> being a region containing 
            related information, and  inherits requesting a navigation mode change. A graphics 
            document has three properties that distinguish it from other top level roles for graphics. 
            The three properties of a <code>graphics-doc</code> are: the graphic is structured - that is it has organization, 
            a <code>graphics-doc</code> could stand alone without surrounding content and a <code>graphics-doc</code> 
            would like to have it's content navigated in a way that respects the semantic structure of the graphic. 
            In general, structured graphics such as charts, maps, diagrams, technical drawing, blue prints and instructional 
            graphics SHOULD have the <code>graphics-doc</code> role. It is also appropriate to use a <code>graphics-doc</code> role inside a 
            graphic, for example a bar chart that is one panel of a paneled bar chart should have role <code>graphics-doc</code>.
			</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Accessibility technologies that re-format a document 
            should follow the semantic structure of a <code>graphics-doc</code> which may not match the DOM structure.

	<h1>States and Properties</h1>
	<p>WAI-ARIA provides a collection of accessibility state and properties which are used to support platform accessibility APIs on various 
	operating system platforms. Assistive technologies may access this information through an exposed user agent DOM or through a mapping 
	to the platform accessibility API. When combined with roles, the user agent can supply the assistive technologies with user interface 
	information to convey to the user at any time. Changes in states or properties will result in a notification to assistive technologies, 
	which could alert the user that a change has occurred.</p>
