	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a technical specification that provides a framework to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. It enables web browsers to map the accessibility semantics in web content to platform-specific accessibility APIs. This enables web content to be interoperable with platform assistive technologies, similar to native platform applications, without requiring authors to include platform dependencies.</p>
	<p>This specification is a modular extension of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> designed to support graphics. The goals of this specification include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Expanding [[!WAI-ARIA]] to produce semantic extensions to support structured graphics such as charts, graphs, maps, technical drawings and scientific diagrams. It has applicability to both Scalable Vector Graphics as well as HTML5 Canvas.</li> 
		<li>Align with a new governance model for modularization and extensions to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</li> 
		<li>Provide structural semantics extensions that will support both assistive technologies and enable semantic navigation, alternative styling, and interactivity support.</li> 
	</ul>
  <p>This specification defines the core roles that would be used in all structured graphics or diagrams.  Future work will expand on this framework to enable more detailed annotation of data-rich graphics such as charts or maps.</p>
	<p>For a more detailed explanation of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> please refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA Introduction</a> and how it applies to Rich Internet Application Accessibility.</p> 
	
	<section id="target-audience">
		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>This specification defines a module of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for graphics, including <a data-lt="role">roles</a>, <a data-lt="state">states</a>, <a data-lt="property">properties</a> and values.<!-- Again, edit as required re states/properties --> It impacts several audiences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a data-lt="user agent">User agents</a> that process content containing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features;</li>
			<li><a>Assistive technologies</a> that provide specialized reading experiences to users with disabilities;</li>
			<li>Authors of web graphics;</li>
			<li>Authoring tools that help authors create conforming graphics; and</li>
			<li>Conformance checkers, that verify appropriate use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and this Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each conformance requirement indicates the audience to which it applies.</p>
		<!--p>Although this specification is applicable to the above audiences, it is not specifically targeted to, nor is it intended to be the sole source of information for, any of these audiences. In the future, additional documents will be created to assist authors in applying these <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics for graphics and to define how the information in this document is mapped to platform accessibility APIs.</p--> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="ua-support">
		<h2>User Agent Support</h2>
		<p>This module builds on the general <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#ua-support">User Agent support principles</a> defined in [[!WAI-ARIA]] by also providing the ability for user agents to enhance the general user interface presented to readers.</p> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="co-evolution">
		<h2>Co-Evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h2>
		<p>The Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module follows the model for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#co-evolution">co-evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages</a> defined in [[!WAI-ARIA]]. It is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like [[HTML5]], [[!SVG2]] and EPUB, or to be used as an accessibility enhancement technology in other markup-based languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. It clarifies semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of objects, via style and script, that are not yet directly supported by the language of the page, because the invention of new types of objects is faster than standardized support for them appears in web languages.</p>
		<p>It is not appropriate to create objects with style and script when the host language provides a semantic element for that type of objects. While <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can improve the accessibility of these objects, accessibility is best provided by allowing the user agent to handle the object natively. For example, it is not better to use a <rref>heading</rref> role on a <code>div</code> element than it is to use a native heading element, such as an <code>h1</code>.</p>
		<p>It is expected that, over time, host languages will evolve to provide semantics for objects that currently can only be declared with this specification. This is natural and desirable, as one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to help stimulate the emergence of more semantic and accessible markup. When native semantics for a given feature become available, it is appropriate for authors to use the native feature and stop using this module for that feature. Legacy content may continue to use the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module, however, so the need for user agents to support it remains.</p>
		<p>While specific features of this module may lose importance over time, the general possibility of the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module to add semantics to web graphics or open web based standards, is expected to be a persistent need. Host languages may not implement all the semantics this module provides, and various host languages may implement different subsets of the features. New types of objects are continually being developed, and one goal of this specification is to provide a way to make such objects accessible, because authoring practices often advance faster than host language standards. In this way, this module and host languages both evolve together but at different rates.</p>
		<p>Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example, SVG expresses the semantics behind production of graphical objects, not of user interface components that those objects may represent. Host languages such as these might, by design, not provide native semantics that map to this specification's features. In these cases, the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module could be adopted as a long-term approach to add semantic information to these host languages.</p>

		<h2>Authoring Practices</h2>
		<section id="authoring_tools">
			<h3>Authoring Tools</h3>
			<p>Many of the requirements in the definitions of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a data-lt="role">roles</a>, <a data-lt="state">states</a> and <a data-lt="property">properties</a> can be checked automatically during the development process, similar to other quality control processes used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating graphics, these tools can compare the semantic structure of Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> to that defined in this specification and notify the author of errors or simply create templates that enforce that structure.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="authoring_testing">
			<h3>Testing Practices and Tools</h3> 
			<p>The accessibility of interactive content cannot be confirmed by static checks alone. Developers of interactive content should test for device-independent access to <a data-lt="widget">widgets</a> and applications, and should verify accessibility <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> access to all content and changes during user interaction.</p>

		<h2>Assistive Technologies</h2>
		<p>Programmatic access to accessibility semantics is essential for assistive technologies. For more information, refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#at_support">Assistive Technologies</a> section in [[!WAI-ARIA]].</p>

<section class="normative" id="conformance">
	<p>This specification indicates whether a section is <a>normative</a> or <a>informative</a>. Classifying a section as normative or informative applies to the entire section. A statement "This section is normative" or "This section is informative" applies to all sub-sections of that section.</p>
	<p>Normative sections provide requirements that authors, user agents and assistive technologies MUST follow for an implementation to conform to this specification.</p>
	<p>Informative sections provide information useful to understanding the specification. Such sections may contain examples of recommended practice, but it is not required to follow such recommendations in order to conform to this specification.</p>

	<h1>Graphics Roles</h1>    
	<p>
      This section defines additions to the 
      <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 
      <a>role</a> <a>taxonomy</a> 
      and describes the characteristics and properties of all <a data-lt="role">roles</a>. 
      See <a href="aria.html#roles">ARIA Roles</a> for descriptions 
      of the fields provided by this module.
	</p>
	 <p>
     Authors are given the ability to influence what is presented 
     to assistive technologies and to influence navigation through
     the use of roles and properties. With graphics, there are many 
     cases where presenting and navigating every element will make the 
     graphic harder to understand and use. 
     Authors may mark elements for exclusion 
     from the semantic representation of the document 
     (the accessibility tree) by assigning 
     the role <rref>none</rref> or <rref>presentation</rref>.  
     The element with this role should be treated transparently 
     by assistive technologies, as if its children or text content 
     were directly contained by its parent element.
  </p>  
   <p>
     In addition, certain roles, 
     such as <rref>img</rref> or <rref>graphics-symbol</rref>, 
     when assigned to a parent element, will cause all child 
     DOM structure to be omitted from the accessibility tree.
     This is indicated by the "Children Presentational"
     value in the role characteristics table.
     Finally, the native semantics of the graphics language 
     may also default to ignoring DOM structure that does not have
     semantic data attached; for SVG, this is defined in [[SVG-AAM]].
  </p>
  <p>A role of <code>none</code> should never be used 
    for interactive elements or those with WAI-ARIA states and properties.</p>

			<div class="role">
			<rdef>graphics-doc</rdef>
			<div class="role-description">
        <p>
          A type of <rref>document</rref> in which 
          the visual appearance or layout of content conveys meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to other <rref>document</rref> types, 
          the <code>graphics-doc</code> role applies to the root element of
          a region of the page containing related information,
          where the user's primary interaction mode is expected to be
          browsing the document rather than controlling an application.  
          The element with this role 
          may be the root element of the document file, 
          or of a nested structure within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>graphics-doc</code> may be distinguished 
          from similar roles as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>
            Relative to other documents, a <code>graphics-doc</code> 
            is distinguished by the semantic importance of its 
            visual (usually two-dimensional) representation.
            User agents and assistive technologies
            SHOULD take this into consideration 
            when supporting navigation of the graphic.
            Accessibility technologies that re-format or re-style a document 
            SHOULD NOT alter the layout of a <code>graphics-doc</code> 
            except in ways that are consistent 
            with the semantic roles and relationships of its content.
          </p></li>
              <li><p>
            Relative to an <rref>img</rref>, a <code>graphics-doc</code> 
            is distinguished by the structured nature of its content.
            Its child elements may have semantic meaning,
            and may include links or other interactive widgets.
          </p></li>
              <li><p>
            Relative to a <rref>graphics-object</rref>, 
            a <code>graphics-doc</code> is self-contained.  
            Its meaning persists when separated from surrounding content.
            The element with the <code>graphics-doc</code> role defines
            the scope and context for interpretation of the child content.
          </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In general, authors SHOULD use the <code>graphics-doc</code> role 
          for structured graphics such as 
          charts, maps, diagrams, technical drawing, blue prints and instructional graphics. 
          However, if a single large graphic has discrete regions
          that may be safely re-arranged without sacrificing meaning,
          each of those regions SHOULD be a distinct <code>graphics-doc</code>.
          An alternative role (such as <rref>figure</rref>) 
          may be used to group them together.
          One <code>graphics-doc</code> may also be nested inside another, 
          for example a bar chart that is embedded in a map
          or a matrix of chart panels 
          should have a role of <code>graphics-doc</code>.
          The nested document provides encapsulation; 
          navigation between components of 
          the inner and outer graphics should be explicit.
			 </p>
         <div class="note">
           <p>
            To support user agents and assistive technologies 
            based on the ARIA 1.0 specification, 
            authors may wish to include the <rref>document</rref> role 
            as a fallback value, 
            in the form <code>role="graphics-doc document"</code>.
           </p>
           <p>
             Future specifications may define more specific roles
             for particular types of graphical documents with
             special semantic structures.  Those more specific roles
             would be subclasses of <code>graphics-doc</code>.

			<div class="role-description">
        <p>
          A section of a <rref>graphics-doc</rref>
          that represents a distinct object or sub-component
          with semantic meaning.  
          A graphical object may itself have nested sub-components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Container elements that instead represent a collection
          of disconnected objects should instead be given the
          <rref>group</rref> or <rref>list</rref> roles.
          Grouping elements that do not have semantic meaning 
          and do not alter the semantic context provided by an ancestor
          SHOULD NOT be given a role, 
          which may be explicitly indicated 
          with the role <rref>none</rref> or <rref>presentation</rref>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike a <rref>graphics-doc</rref>, 
          a <code>graphics-object</code> need not be self-contained,
          and it does not establish a new context for navigation.  
          However, user agents and assistive technologies 
          SHOULD provide a way for users, particularly non-visual users,
          to navigate the nested structure of objects 
          in a hierarchical manner, similar to nested lists.
        </p>
         <p class="note">
            To support user agents and assistive technologies 
            based on the ARIA 1.0 specification, 
            authors may wish to include the <rref>group</rref> role
            as a fallback value, 
            in the form <code>role="graphics-object group"</code>.
        </p>

        
<div class="example">
  <p>
    The code that follows is a portion of the markup for a 
    structured graphic.  It includes SVG <code>g</code> grouping
    elements with various roles:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>graphics-object</code> for distinct objects,
      such as the house, its door, or roof.</li>
    <li>
      <rref>group</rref> to group together the windows
      or the trees (multiple distinct objects) 
      with a single label or description.
    </li>
    <li>
      <rref>img</rref> for the background which is described as a whole.
    </li>
    <li>
      <rref>none</rref> for elements that apply styles or transformations
      without having any semantic meaning.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Where a graphical object has multiple sub-components, the
    group role is provided as an explicit fallback.

		<h2>Other Roles for Graphics</h2>
		<p>	The following core ARIA roles, defined in [[WAI-ARIA]], are also 
      relevant for annotating graphics:
    </p>
		<ul>
      <li>
        <rref>img</rref> (image) defines a single graphic
        that is perceived as an indivisible whole. 
        Unlike a <rref>graphics-doc</rref>, 
        an image cannot have navigable or interactive child content.
        Unlike a <rref>graphics-symbol</rref>, 
        an image may require a detailed text description
        to fully convey its meaning to non-visual users.
      </li>
      <li>
        <rref>figure</rref> defines a container element
        for content (including graphics) that is a key part 
        of the containing document but is outside the 
        normal reading stream.  
        A figure will often contain one or more elements 
        with the <rref>img</rref> or <rref>graphics-doc</rref> roles,
        but may also contain text captions, credits, or other related content.
      </li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
      The following examples demonstrate appropriate use of 
      <rref>img</rref>, <rref>figure</rref>, and <rref>graphics-doc</rref>
      in a document.
    </p>
    
<div class="example">
  <p>
    Within an HTML 5 document, an inline SVG
    may sometimes represent an atomic <code>img</code>.
    If the graphics form part of the natural reading flow
    of the text, then this role is sufficient, as in the first example:
  </p>

<object type="text/html" data="img/img-role-for-svg.html"></object>
<pre class="example highlight">
&lt;p&gt;A repeating SVG gradient is defined using the
    &lt;code&gt;spreadMethod&lt;/code&gt; attribute.  
    A value of &lt;code&gt;repeat&lt;/code&gt; causes the color stops
    to repeat in the same order, from beginning to end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;svg class="inline-example" role="img"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;A repeating linear gradient&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;desc&gt;The gradient starts dark, slowly shifting to light, 
        then quickly dark again.  This pattern repeats four
        times left to right, each time brightening across a large
        region and then getting dark within a short space.
    &lt;/desc&gt;
    &lt;linearGradient id="repeat" x2="25%" spreadMethod="repeat"&gt;
        &lt;stop offset="0"     stop-color="black" /&gt;
        &lt;stop offset="0.8" stop-color="white" /&gt;
        &lt;stop offset="1"     stop-color="black" /&gt;
    &lt;/linearGradient&gt;
    &lt;rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#repeat)" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
</pre>
  
  <p>
    The following example provides the same content, 
      but now structured as a figure that may be re-positioned
      separately from the flow of paragraph text.
  </p>
    <object type="text/html" data="img/nested-figures.html"></object>
<pre class="example highlight">
&lt;figure id="fig1" role="figure region"&gt;
    &lt;svg id="fig1A" class="nested-figure" role="figure"
         aria-labelledby="fig1-caption, fig1A-caption"&gt;
        &lt;!-- markup omitted--&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;svg id="fig1B" class="nested-figure" role="figure"
         aria-labelledby="fig1-caption, fig1B-caption"&gt;
        &lt;linearGradient id="reflect" spreadMethod="reflect"
                        xlink:href="#repeat" /&gt;
        &lt;text id="fig1B-caption" class="caption" dy="1em"
              &gt;b) spreadMethod="reflect"&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;rect role="img"
              y="25%" width="100%" height="75%" fill="url(#reflect)" &gt;
            &lt;title&gt;A reflecting linear gradient&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;desc&gt;The gradient again starts dark, slowly shifting to light, 
              then quickly dark again.  However, the next repeat shifts
              quickly to the light, then slowly back dark.  
              The original pattern is then repeated, followed by the reflected
              version again.
            &lt;/desc&gt;
        &lt;/rect&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;figcaption id="fig1-caption"
                &gt;Figure 1: Repeating SVG gradients&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
</pre>
  
  <p>
    Finally, the last version uses a <rref>graphics-doc</rref>
    to include complex annotations on the graphic, 
    which is still contained within a figure element.
    The two sections of the graphic are <rref>graphics-object</rref> elements,
    while the annotations have individual labels and descriptions.
  </p>
    <object type="text/html" data="img/figure-graphics-doc.html"></object>
    <pre class="example highlight">
&lt;figure id="fig1" role="figure region"&gt;
    &lt;svg role="graphics-doc"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Repeating versus reflecting linear gradients&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;desc&gt;
            The graphic shows two gradient patterns,
            annotated with text labels and arrows.
            Both gradients use the same series of color stops,
            starting dark, slowly shifting to light, 
            then quickly dark again.
            This cycle covers one-quarter of the width of the graphic,
            starting on the left.
            The two gradients differ in their repeat cycles.
        &lt;/desc&gt;
        &lt;defs&gt;
            &lt;!-- markup omitted --&gt;
        &lt;/defs&gt;
        &lt;g role="graphics-object" aria-labelledby="repeat-label"&gt;
            &lt;!-- markup omitted --&gt;
        &lt;/g&gt;            
        &lt;g role="graphics-object" aria-labelledby="reflect-label"&gt;
            &lt;desc&gt;
                The gradient stretches across the bottom half of 
                the graphic.
                Each cycle of the gradient alternates direction,
                left-to-right then right-to-left,
                as do the arrows that emphasize the pattern.
            &lt;/desc&gt;
            &lt;rect y="50%" width="100%" height="50%" fill="url(#reflect)" /&gt;
            &lt;/rect&gt;
            &lt;use y="70%" xlink:href="#gradient-vector" &gt;
                &lt;title&gt;1st cycle&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;desc&gt;left-to-right arrow, starting from x="0"&lt;/desc&gt;
            &lt;/use&gt;
            &lt;use y="70%" x="-50%" transform="scale(-1,1)"
                 xlink:href="#gradient-vector" &gt;
                &lt;title&gt;2nd cycle, reflected&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;desc&gt;right-to-left arrow, ending at x="25%"&lt;/desc&gt;
            &lt;/use&gt;
            &lt;use y="70%" x="50%" xlink:href="#gradient-vector" &gt;
                &lt;title&gt;3rd cycle&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;desc&gt;left-to-right arrow, starting from x="50%"&lt;/desc&gt;
            &lt;/use&gt;
            &lt;use y="70%" x="-100%" transform="scale(-1,1)"
                 xlink:href="#gradient-vector" &gt;
                &lt;title&gt;4th cycle, reflected&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;desc&gt;right-to-left arrow, ending at x="75%"&lt;/desc&gt;
            &lt;/use&gt;
            &lt;text id="reflect-label" class="overlay-text"

                  &gt;reflect&lt;/text&gt;
        &lt;/g&gt;

	<h1>States and Properties</h1>
	<p>WAI-ARIA provides a collection of accessibility state and properties which are used to support platform accessibility APIs on various 
	operating system platforms. Assistive technologies may access this information through an exposed user agent DOM or through a mapping 
	to the platform accessibility API. When combined with roles, the user agent can supply the assistive technologies with user interface 
	information to convey to the user at any time. Changes in states or properties will result in a notification to assistive technologies, 
	which could alert the user that a change has occurred.</p>
