	<p>Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about widgets, structures and behaviors in order to allow assistive technologies to convey appropriate information to persons with disabilities. This specification defines a [[!WAI-ARIA]] module encompassing an ontology of <a title="role">roles</a>, <a title="state">states</a> and <a title="property">properties</a> specific to the web graphics. These semantics are designed to allow an author to convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies and to enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features used by readers. It is expected this will complement [[HTML5]].</p>
	<p>This document is part of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> suite described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Overview</a>.</p>

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is a technical specification that defines a common host language semantic accessibility API and framework that enables web browsers to map the accessibility semantics in web content to platform-specific accessibility APIs. This enables web content to be interoperable with platform assistive technologies similar to native platform applications without platform dependencies.</p>
	<p>This specification is a modular extension of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> designed to support graphics. The goals of this specification include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Expanding [[!WAI-ARIA]] to produce structural semantic extensions to support graphics such as charts, graphs, maps technical drawings and scientific diagrams. It has applicability to both Scalable Vector Graphics as well as HTML5 Canvas.</li> 
		<li>Align with a new governance model for modularization and extensions to <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>.</li> 
		<li>Provide structural semantics extensions that will support both assistive technologies and enable semantic navigation, styling and interactive features used by readers.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p>For a more detailed explanation of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> please refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA Introduction</a> and how it applies to Rich Internet Application Accessibility.</p> 
	
	<section id="target-audience">
		<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>This specification defines a module of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> for graphics, including <a title="role">roles</a>, <a title="state">states</a>, <a title="property">properties</a> and values. It impacts several audiences:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a title="user agent">User agents</a> that process content containing <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and graphics (SVG) <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> features;</li>
			<li><a>Assistive technologies</a> that provide specialized reading experiences to users with disabilities;</li>
			<li>Authors of web graphics (SVG);</li>
			<li>Authoring tools that help authors create conforming graphics; and</li>
			<li>Conformance checkers, that verify appropriate use of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and this Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each conformance requirement indicates the audience to which it applies.</p>
		<p>Although this specification is applicable to the above audiences, it is not specifically targeted to, nor is it intended to be the sole source of information for, any of these audiences. In the future, additional documents will be created to assist authors in applying these <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> semantics for graphics and to define how the information in this document is mapped to platform accessibility APIs.</p> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="ua-support">
		<h2>User Agent Support</h2>
		<p>This module builds on the general <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#ua-support">User Agent support princinples</a> defined in [[!WAI-ARIA]] by also providing the ability for user agents to enhance the general user interface presented to readers.</p> 
	</section>
	
	<section id="co-evolution">
		<h2>Co-Evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Host Languages</h2>
		<p>The Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module follows the model for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#co-evolution">co-evolution of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and host languages</a> defined in [[!WAI-ARIA]]. It is intended to augment semantics in supporting languages like [[HTML5]], [[SVG2]] and EPUB, or to be used as an accessibility enhancement technology in other markup-based languages that do not explicitly include support for ARIA. It clarifies semantics to assistive technologies when authors create new types of objects, via style and script, that are not yet directly supported by the language of the page, because the invention of new types of objects is faster than standardized support for them appears in web languages.</p>
		<p>It is not appropriate to create objects with style and script when the host language provides a semantic element for that type of objects. While <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> can improve the accessibility of these objects, accessibility is best provided by allowing the user agent to handle the object natively. For example, it is not better to use a <rref>heading</rref> role on a <code>div</code> element than it is to use a native heading element, such as an <code>h1</code>.</p>
		<p>It is expected that, over time, host languages will evolve to provide semantics for objects that currently can only be declared with this specification. This is natural and desirable, as one goal of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> is to help stimulate the emergence of more semantic and accessible markup. When native semantics for a given feature become available, it is appropriate for authors to use the native feature and stop using this module for that feature. Legacy content may continue to use the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module, however, so the need for user agents to support it remains.</p>
		<p>While specific features of this module may lose importance over time, the general possibility of the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module to add semantics to web graphics or open web based standards, is expected to be a persistent need. Host languages may not implement all the semantics this module provides, and various host languages may implement different subsets of the features. New types of objects are continually being developed, and one goal of this specification is to provide a way to make such objects accessible, because authoring practices often advance faster than host language standards. In this way, this module and host languages both evolve together but at different rates.</p>
		<p>Some host languages exist to create semantics for features other than the user interface. For example, SVG expresses the semantics behind production of graphical objects, not of user interface components that those objects may represent. Host languages such as these might, by design, not provide native semantics that map to this specification's features. In these cases, the Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> module could be adopted as a longraphics-term approach to add semantic information to these host languages.</p>

		<h2>Authoring Practices</h2>
		<section id="authoring_tools">
			<h3>Authoring Tools</h3>
			<p>Many of the requirements in the definitions of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> and Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> <a title="role">roles</a>, <a title="state">states</a> and <a title="property">properties</a> can be checked automatically during the development process, similar to other quality control processes used for validating code. To assist authors who are creating graphics, can compare the semantic structure of Graphics <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles from the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> to that defined in this specification and notify the author of errors or simply create templates that enforce that structure.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="authoring_testing">
			<h3>Testing Practices and Tools</h3> 
			<p>The accessibility of interactive content cannot be confirmed by static checks alone. Developers of interactive content should test for device-independent access to <a title="widget">widgets</a> and applications, and should verify accessibility <abbr title="application programing interface">API</abbr> access to all content and changes during user interaction.</p>

		<h2>Assistive Technologies</h2>
		<p>Programmatic access to accessibility semantics is essential for assistive technologies. For more information, refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#at_support">Assistive Technologies</a> section in [[!WAI-ARIA]].</p>

<section class="normative" id="conformance">
	<p>This specification indicates whether a section is <a>normative</a> or <a>informative</a>. Classifying a section as normative or informative applies to the entire section. A statement "This section is normative" or "This section is informative" applies to all sub-sections of that section.</p>
	<p>Normative sections provide requirements that authors, user agents and assistive technologies MUST follow for an implementation to conform to this specification.</p>
	<p>Informative sections provide information useful to understanding the specification. Such sections may contain examples of recommended practice, but it is not required to follow such recommendations in order to conform to this specification.</p>

	<h1>States and Properties</h1>
	<p>WAI-ARIA provides a collection of accessibility state and properties which are used to support platform accessibility APIs on various 
	operating system platforms. Assistive technologies may access this information through an exposed user agent DOM or through a mapping 
	to the platform accessibility API. When combined with roles, the user agent can supply the assistive technologies with user interface 
	information to convey to the user at any time. Changes in states or properties will result in a notification to assistive technologies, 
	which could alert the user that a change has occurred.</p>
	<p>Assistive technology may use <pref>aria-gtype</pref> as an adjective for the role in name calculation.</p>
	<section id="manageing-navigation">
	<h2>Managing navigation</h2>
	<p>Roles, states and properties can be used to manage graphics navigation. Properties can be used to manage navigation behavior and
	differentiate between graphics features with the same role and same semantic parent. Customized navigation behavior may be needed when 
	statistics produce multiple data columns. For example, data for a box and whisker plot are produced by statistics, and 
	the statistic produces columns for the fence, box, median and outliers. Outliers can be classified in more than one way and 
	different statistics can produce different flavors of boxes and fences and outliers. The semantics of the statistic need to be accurately 
	communicated to the user during exploration. Charts, instructional diagrams, chemical models and maps are examples of graphics that
	may need customizable navigation.
	</p>
	<p>The following properties can modify navigation behavior:
	<ul>
	<li><pref>aria-gtype</pref></li>
	</ul>

	<h1>Schemata</h1>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Working Group</a> has incorporated the WAI-ARIA attributes into <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML 5</a>. Official support for WAI-ARIA in HTML is provided in that specification.</p>
	<p class="ednote">Validation support for the roles defined in this module will be added once the specification reaches recommendation.</p>
	<p>For information on incorporating WAI-ARIA into other grammars, refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#a_schemata">Appendix A</a> of [[!WAI-ARIA]]</p>
