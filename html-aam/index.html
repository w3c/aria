        HTML Accessibility API Mappings (HTML-AAM) defines how <a class="termref">user agents</a> map <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> [[HTML]] elements and attributes to platform
        <a class="termref" data-lt="accessibility API">accessibility application programming interfaces (<abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">APIs</abbr>)</a>. It leverages and extends the
        [[[core-aam-1.2]]] and the [[[accname-1.2]]] for use with the HTML host language. Documenting these mappings promotes interoperable exposure of roles, states, properties, and events
        implemented by accessibility APIs and helps to ensure that this information appears in a manner consistent with author intent.

        This document was initially developed by and with the approval of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/html-accessibility-tf.html">HTML Accessibility Taskforce</a>, a joint task force of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">Protocols and Formats Working Group</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/wg/">HTML Working Group</a>. Work continued with the successor groups
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/webapps/">Web Applications Working Group</a>. This

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines how HTML user agents respond to and expose [=role=], [=state=] and [=ARIA/property=] information provided for Web content. Unless indicated otherwise, an HTML
        element or attribute with default [[[wai-aria-1.2]]] semantics must be exposed to the platform <a class="termref">accessibility APIs</a> according to the relevant WAI-ARIA mappings defined in
        the [[[core-aam-1.2]]] specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, often due to features of the HTML host language or the accessibility API in question, an element or attribute's mapping differs from the corresponding ARIA mappings specified in
        the [[core-aam-1.2]]. Where an HTML element or attribute does not have any default WAI-ARIA semantics, the applicable mapping for each platform <a class="termref">accessibility API</a> is
        defined by this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document also adapts the [[[accname-1.2]]] specification for deriving the <a data-cite="accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-name">accessible names</a> and
        <a data-cite="accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-description">accessible descriptions</a> of [[HTML]] elements, and provides accessible implementation examples for specific HTML elements and
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users often access HTML content using assistive technologies that rely on platform <a class="termref">accessibility <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></a> to obtain and
        interact with information from the page. This document is part of the following suite of accessibility API mapping specifications for content rendered by user agents:

        <h3>Exposing HTML Features That Do Not Directly Map to Accessibility APIs</h3>
        <p>
          HTML can include features that are not supported by <a class="termref">accessibility APIs</a> at the time of publication. There is not a one to one relationship between all features and
          platform <a class="termref">accessibility APIs</a>. When HTML roles, states and properties do not directly map to an <a class="termref">accessibility API</a>, and there is a method in the
          API to expose a text string, user agents MUST expose the undefined role, states and properties via that method.

        <p>
          For HTML elements or attributes with default WAI-ARIA semantics, user agents MUST conform to

        <h3 id="minimum-role">Exposing HTML Features That Require a Minimum Role</h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>minimum role</dfn> is the equivalent WAI-ARIA role an element will map to if the element does not have a more specific implicit role or platform role mappings, e.g., a non-generic
          role. This can help ensure that users of assistive technologies get the best possible experience for commonly-used and valid HTML markup where otherwise a role would not be exposed.
        </p>
        <p>A minimum role is provided when all of the following conditions are true:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the author has <strong>not</strong> specified a valid explicit WAI-ARIA role to the element, <strong>or</strong> the specified role is either `none`, `presentation`, or `generic`;</li>
          <li>the element either has no implicit WAI-ARIA role or platform role mappings, or it has an implicit `generic` or `none` computed role;</li>
          <li>and the author has specified attributes which require a minimum role mapping for the element.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <a href="#html-attribute-state-and-property-mappings">HTML Attribute State and Property Mappings</a> section identifies the specific global attributes which would require an element map
          to a minimum role.
        </p>
        <p>
          When these conditions are met, user agents MUST expose an object using the mappings defined in CORE-AAM for the specified minimum role. If the element has multiple attributes specified which
          require a minimum role be returned as the computed role for the element, prioritize the more specific role in the ARIA taxonomy.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>HTML Element Role Mappings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            User agents MUST map HTML elements with implicit WAI-ARIA role semantics to platform <a class="termref">accessibility APIs</a> according to the identified WAI-ARIA role mapping as defined
            in the [[core-aam-1.2]] specification.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Not mapped" means the element does not need to be exposed via an <a class="termref">accessibility API</a>. This is usually because the element is not displayed as part of the user
            interface. However, authors can force some of these elements to be rendered. For instance, by overriding user agent styles to render elements that would have been otherwise set to
            `display: none`. In these cases, the user agent SHOULD map such elements to the role of <a class="core-mapping" href="#role-map-generic">`generic`</a>, unless other HTML features have been
            specified which would require a more specific <a>minimum role</a> to be exposed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where an element is indicated as having &quot;No corresponding (WAI-ARIA) role&quot;, or is mapped to the <a class="core-mapping" href="#role-map-generic">`generic`</a> role, user agents
            MUST NOT expose the <a class="core-mapping" href="#ariaRoleDescription">`aria-roledescription`</a> property value in the <a class="termref">accessibility tree</a> unless the element has an
            explicit, conforming `role` attribute value which [[WAI-ARIA-1.2]] does not prohibit the use of `aria-roledescription`.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some HTML elements expose implicit WAI-ARIA roles depending on whether they have been provided an <a data-cite="accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-name">accessible name</a>. How an element
            participates in the computation of its own or another element's <a data-cite="accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-name">accessible name</a> and/or
            <a data-cite="accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-description">accessible description</a> is described in the
            <a href="#accessible-name-and-description-computation">Accessible Name and Description Computation</a> section of this document.

        <ul>
          <li>
            When HTML elements do not have an exact or equivalent mapping to a valid, non-abstract <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> role, a unique `computedrole`
            string has been specified to serve as the return value for interoperability testing purposes. For instance, user agents MAY expose the `video` element with a `computedrole` of
            "`html-video`". Authors MUST NOT use any `html-`prefixed computed role string in the role attribute (such as `html-video`). User Agents MUST ignore any abstract or invalid role token.
            <div class="example">
              <code> &lt;video> &lt;!-- computedrole returns 'html-video' --> &lt;main role="html-video"> &lt;!-- Author error. computed role returns 'main' --> </code>

                When a <a data-cite="html/forms.html#category-label">labelable element</a> is referenced by a `label` element's `for` attribute, or a descendant of a `label` element, the labelable
                element's UIA `LabeledBy` property points to the UIA element for the `label` element.
              </li>
              <li>
                Elements mapped to the `Text` Control Type are not generally represented as <a class="termref" data-lt="accessible object">accessible objects</a> in the

        <h3>HTML Attribute State and Property Mappings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            User agents MUST map HTML attributes with default WAI-ARIA state and property semantics to platform <a class="termref">accessibility APIs</a> according to the identified WAI-ARIA state and
            property mapping as defined in the [[core-aam-1.2]] specification.
          </li>
          <li>A '?' in a cell indicates the data has yet to be provided.</li>
          <li>
            "Not mapped" (Not Applicable) means the attribute does not need to be exposed via an <a class="termref">accessibility API</a>. This is usually because the attribute is not displayed as
            part of the user interface.
            <div class="note">
              In some cases, while not directly exposed to accessibility APIs, an attribute can still impact the accessibility of an element. e.g., <a href="#att-autoplay">`autoplay`</a> will
              automatically start playing <a href="#el-video">`video`</a> or <a href="#el-audio">`audio`</a> elements.
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>All elements having an accessible object in IAccessible2 mapping are supposed to implement IAccessible, IAccessible2 and IAccessible2_2 interfaces.</li>
          <li>
            User interaction with certain HTML elements will set an element's <a data-cite="html/form-control-infrastructure.html#concept-fe-dirty">dirty value flag</a>. These elements, as identified
            in [HTML], could have attributes that represent the default value or state of the element. When the dirty flag is set, that default value or state does not necessarily determine the value
            or state of the element or corresponding accessible node.
          </li>
        </ul>

                  <a class="termref">accessibility tree</a>, or never created in the first place. Instead, they expose the list item marker as part of the associated list item's accessible text. In
                  these cases, implementors need to consider such things as adjusting the offsets (e.g., for caret-moved events, text-selection events, etc.) for the updated list item text that now
                  also contains the list item marker as content, rather than just taking the offsets unmodified from the list item renderer.

        The terms <a data-cite="accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-name">accessible name</a> and <a data-cite="accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-description">accessible description</a> are properties provided in

        The <a href="#mapping_additional_nd_te" class="accname">text alternative computation</a> is used to generate both the <a data-cite="accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-name">accessible name</a> and

      </p>
      <p class="note">
        User Agents notify assistive technology when relevant accessibility information changes, sometimes by destroying and recreating the accessibility object, or sometimes by notifying of changes

        In accordance with <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/design-principles/#do-not-expose-use-of-assistive-tech">Web Platform Design Principles</a>, this specification provides no programmatic
        interface to determine if information is being used by Assistive Technologies. However, this specification does allow an author to present different information to users of Assistive
        Technologies from the information available to users who do not use Assistive Technologies. This is possible using many features of the ARIA and CORE-AAM specifications, just as this is
        possible using many other parts of the web technology stack. This content disparity could be abused to perform
