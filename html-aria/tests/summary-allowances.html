	<main>
		<h2>Tests:</h2>

		<div class="flex">
			<div class="widgetDemo">
				<h3>Test 1</h3>
				<p>Authors can't use <code>aria-expanded</code> or <code>aria-pressed</code> 
          attributes on a <code>summary</code> element if it serves as the summary for its parent details element.</p>

				<div class="testcase">
					<p>An aria-expanded attribute is ignored by user agents</p>
          <details open>
            <summary aria-expanded=false>test 1</summary>
            has aria-expanded=false attribute
          </details>
				</div>
        
        <div class="testcase">
					<p>An aria-pressed attribute is ignored by user agents</p>
          <details open>
            <summary aria-pressed=true>test 2</summary>
            has aria-pressed=true attribute
          </details>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Expected result:</strong>
				<br>As these attributes presently have no negative impact on the user experience, it seems that at the very least, 
          conformance checkers should produce a warning about their use, since these 'were' previously 'allowed' but likely 
          served no practical value then either.  However, a conformance checker may expose these attributes as an error as well, as other
        allowed attribute checks that already exist may expose similar errors. E.g., <code>div aria-expanded=true</code> is another example of
        an invalid attribute being used on a generic element.  </p>
			</div>
      
      <div class="widgetDemo">
         <h3>Test 2</h3>
				<p>Authors MAY specify any role on a summary element, so long as that summary element is not the 'summay for its parent details'.</p>

				<div class="testcase">
					<p>The summary elements beyond the first instance do not pass the algorithm to be a summary for its parent details, 
						so they are exposed as generic elements.</p>
          <details open>
            <summary>no allowed role on this summary</summary>
            <summary role=paragraph>this summary has a paragraph role, which is fine.</summary>
		  <summary role=button tabindex=0>this summary has a button role, which is also fine.</summary>
          </details>
				</div>
        
        <div class="testcase">
					<p>The following summary element is not a child of a details element, and thus is implicitly exposed as a generic.</p>
          <summary role=paragraph>this summary has a paragraph role, which is fine.</summary>
        </div>
	      <p><strong>Expected result:</strong>
				<br>Conformance checkers need not throw an error for summary elements that are not the first  
		      instance of the element type within a details element, 
		      or are not a descendant element of a details element.  
		      
	      </p>
        
      </div>
			
			<div class="widgetDemo">
				<h3>Test 3</h3>
				<p>Authors can use <code>aria-disabled</code> or <code>aria-haspopup</code> 
          attributes on a <code>summary</code> element when it serves as the summary for its parent details element.</p>

				<div class="testcase">
					<p>Using an aria-disabled attribute is allowed</p>
          <details open>
            <summary aria-disabled=true>test 1</summary>
            has aria-disabled=true attribute
          </details>
				</div>
        
        <div class="testcase">
					<p>AUsing an aria-haspopup attribute is allowed</p>
          <details open>
            <summary aria-haspopup=true>test 2</summary>
            has aria-haspopup=true attribute
          </details>
				</div>

				<p><strong>Expected result:</strong>
				<br>The aria-disabled and aria-haspopup attributes both have good support and are valid to use on the summary element when it acts as the interactive trigger for the details/summary disclosure widget. Other checks may be necessary to ensure that developers are using these attributes correctly, but that is beyond the scope of what ARIA in HTML covers.</p>
