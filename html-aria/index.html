        This specification defines the authoring rules (author conformance requirements) for the use
        of [[[wai-aria-1.2]]] and [[[dpub-aria-1.0]]] attributes on [[HTML]] elements.
        This specification's primary objective is to define requirements for use
        with conformance checking tools used by authors (i.e., web developers). These requirements will aid authors
        in their development of web content, including custom interfaces and widgets, which make use of ARIA to
        complement or extend the features of the host language [[HTML]].

      <p>
        ARIA in HTML is an [[HTML]] specification module. Any HTML features, conformance requirements, or terms that this specification
        module makes reference to, but does not explicitly define, are defined by the [[HTML|HTML Standard]].

        Author requirements for use of ARIA in HTML
      </h2>
      <p>
        Authors MAY use the ARIA `role` and `aria-*` attributes to change
        the exposed meaning (<a data-cite="html/dom.html#semantics-2">semantics</a>) of
        [=HTML elements=], in accordance with the requirements defined by
        [[wai-aria-1.2|WAI-ARIA]], except where ARIA features conflict with the
        <dfn data-cite="wai-aria-1.2#host_general_conflict">strong native semantics</dfn>
        or are equal to the
        <dfn data-cite="wai-aria-1.2#implicit_semantics">implicit ARIA semantics</dfn>
        of a given HTML element. The <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a> for the features
        of HTML are defined by the [[html-aam-1.0|HTML Accessibility API Mappings]] specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any constraints for the use of ARIA features in HTML defined by this specification 
        are intended to prevent authors from making assistive technology products report 
        nonsensical user interface (UI) information that does not represent the actual UI
        of the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors MUST NOT use the ARIA `role` and `aria-*` attributes in a manner that conflicts 
        with the semantics described in the [[[#docconformance]]] and [[[#docconformance-attr]]] 
        tables. It is NOT RECOMMENDED for authors to set the ARIA `role` and `aria-*` attributes 
        to values that match the <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a> defined in either table. 
        Doing so is unnecessary and can potentially lead to unintended consequences.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>ARIA semantics that extend and diverge from HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Through the use of ARIA, authors can specify semantics that go beyond the current 
        capabilities of native HTML. This can be very useful, as it provides authors the opportunity 
        to create widgets, or expose specific accessible states and properties to native HTML features 
        which would not be possible by the use of HTML alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, a `button` element has no native HTML feature to expose a "pressed" state.
        ARIA allows authors to extend the semantics of the element by specifying the `aria-pressed`
        attribute, allowing for an aural UI that will match the visual presentation of the control.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following example, a `button` element allows for a user to toggle the state of a 
        setting within a web application. The `aria-pressed` attribute is used to 
        augment the `button` element. When in the "pressed" state that information can be
        exposed to users of assistive technologies.
      </p>
      <pre class="HTML example" title="Communicate a button's pressed state with ARIA">
      &lt;button aria-pressed=true>...&lt;/button>
      </pre>
      <p>
        There are also situations where certain `aria-*` attributes are allowed for use on elements 
        with specific `role`s, while the equivalent native attribute is currently not valid in HTML itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, HTML has no direct concept of a disabled hyperlink (`a href` element). 
        Constructs such as `&lt;a href="..." disabled&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;` are not valid, 
        and will not be conveyed to assistive technologies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        ARIA diverges from HTML in this regard and does allow for an `aria-disabled`
        attribute to be specified on an element with an explicit `role=link`. If an author were
        to specify an `aria-disabled=true` on an HTML hyperlink, user agents would not functionally
        treat the hyperlink any differently (it would still be clickable/operable), however it 
        would be exposed to assistive technologies as being in the disabled state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, while native HTML `option` elements that are descendants of a `select` can 
        only be set as being `selected`, elements with an explicit `option` role can not only 
        allow the equivalent `aria-selected`, but also the `aria-checked` attribute, supporting
        widgets/constructs that go beyond the capabilities of a native `select` element.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, in these situations where ARIA and HTML have feature parity, but diverge 
        in allowances, it can create for a misalignment in support, if not also user experiences. 
        In situations where ARIA allows a feature not supported by HTML, it will often
        be in the author's and ultimately the user's best interest to instead implement as a 
        fully custom ARIA widget.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following example, a hyperlink needs to be communicated as being in the disabled
        state. HTML does not allow for the use of the `disabled` attribute on a hyperlink,
        and using `aria-disabled=true` would communicate the hyperlink as being disabled to 
        assistive technologies, but would not actually disable the element. The most effective way 
        to both communicate and actually disable a hyperlink would be to remove the `href` from 
        the [^a^] element, creating a placeholder. Then, ARIA can be applied to this
        placeholder link to communicate the element's intended role and state.
      </p>

        Author guidance to avoid incorrect use of ARIA

      <section>
        <h3>
          Avoid overriding interactive elements with non-interactive roles
        </h3>
        <p>
          ARIA is useful for revising or correcting the role of an element when a different role
          is necessary to expose to users. However, it is rarely in the user or author's best interest
          to try and use ARIA to override an interactive element, for instance a `button`, with a role
          generally exposed by a non-interactive element. For instance, a heading.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an example, the following uses a `role=heading` on a [^button^] element. This is
          not allowed, because the `button` element has default functionality that conflicts with user 
          expectations for the heading role.
        </p>
        <pre class="example HTML" title="Wrong role">
          &lt;button role="heading"&gt;search&lt;/button&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          An author would need to take additional steps to ensure the default functionality and presentation of 
          the `button` was removed, and even doing so may still not be enough to fully supress the element's 
          implicit features depending on how the user chooses to engage with the web page. E.g., by turning on 
          Windows high contrast themes, or viewing the web page in a browser's reader mode.

        <h3>
          Avoid specifying redundant roles
        </h3>
        <p>
          The following example illustrates a [^button^] element which has also been
          provided an explicit `role=button`. Specifying this role is unnecessary, as a "button" 
          element is already exposed with an implicit `button` role. In practice this particular
          instance of redundancy will likely not have unforeseen side effects, other than 
          unnecessarily making the markup more verbose, and incorrectly signaling to other authors 
          that this practice is useful. Please review the section [[[#side-effects]]]
          for an example of where specifying unnecessary roles can be problematic.
        </p>
        <pre class="example HTML" title="Redundant role on button">
          &lt;!-- Avoid doing this! -->
          &lt;button role="button"&gt;...&lt;/button&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          Similarly, the following uses a `role=group` on a [^fieldset^] element, and a `role=Main` on a [^main^] element.
          This is unnecessary, because the `fieldset` element is implicitly exposed as a `role=group`, as is the `main` element 
          implicitly exposed as a `role=main`. Again, in practice this will likely not have any unforeseen side effects to users 
          of assistive technology, as long as the declaration of the `role` value uses [=ASCII lowercase=]. 
          Please see [[[#case-sensitivity]]] for more information.
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="Redundant role on fieldset and main">
          &lt;!-- Avoid doing this! -->
          &lt;fieldset role="group"&gt;...&lt;/fieldset&gt;
          &lt;!-- or this! -->
          &lt;main role="Main">...&lt;/main>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The following uses a `role=list` on an [^ul^] element. As the `ul` element has an implicit role of `list`, 
          explicitly adding the role would generally be considered redundant. However, some user agents suppress a list's
          implicit ARIA semantics if the list markers are removed from the visual presentation of the list items. 
          Generally the redundant declaration of an element's implicit role would not be recommended, but in specific situations
          such as this, and where the role is necessary to expose, authors can explicitly add the role.
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="Redundant role on list">
          &lt;!-- Generally avoid doing this! -->
          &lt;ul role="list"&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;

      </section>

        <h3 id="side-effects">
          Be cautious of side effects
        </h3>
        <p>
          The following uses a `role=button` on a [^summary^] element. This is
          unnecessary and can result in cross-platform issues. For instance,
          preventing the element from correctly exposing its state, and forcing
          the role of `button`, when it might otherwise be exposed with a
          platform or browser specific role.
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="Unintended consequences">
          &lt;details&gt;
            &lt;!-- Avoid doing this! -->
            &lt;summary role="button"&gt;more information&lt;/summary&gt;

        <h3>Adhere to the rules of ARIA</h3>
        <p>
          [[[wai-aria-1.2]]] defines a number of roles which are not meant to be used
          by authors. Many of these roles are categorized as <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2#isAbstract">Abstract Roles</a>
          which are explicitly stated as not to be used by authors. The following example illustrates the invalid use of an
          abstract `select` role, where an author likely meant to use the `combobox` role instead.
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="Abstract roles are not for authors">
          &lt;!-- Do not do this! -->
          &lt;div role="select" ...&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          ARIA also defines a <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2#generic">`generic` role</a> which is meant to provide
          feature parity with a number of HTML elements that do not have more specific ARIA semantics of their
          own. For instance, HTML's [^div^] and [^span^] elements, among others. ARIA discourages authors from
          using the `generic` role as its intended purpose is for use by implementors of user agents.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following example, rather than using a `generic` role, authors are advised to use a `div` in 
          place of the `article` element. If changing the HTML element is not possible, specifying a role of 
          `presentation` or `none` would be acceptable alternaties to remove the implicit role of the `article`.
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="Do not specify elements as generic">
          &lt;!-- Avoid doing this! -->
          &lt;article role="generic" ...>...&lt;/article>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Additionally, ARIA specifically mentions in <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2/#host_general_conflict">Conflicts with Host Language Semantics</a> 
          that if authors use both native HTML features for exposing states and properties as well as their ARIA counterparts, then
          the host language features take priority over the explicit ARIA attributes that are also used.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in the following example an author is using HTML's `input type=checkbox` and has specified an `aria-checked=true`. However,
          user agents are meant to ignore the `aria-checked` attribute. Instead user agents would expose the state based on the native features
          of the form control.
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="The implicit checked state takes precedent over the explicit ARIA attribute">
          &lt;!-- Do not do this! -->
          &lt;input type="checkbox" checked aria-checked="false">
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Adhere to the rules of HTML</h3>
        <p>
          While ARIA can be used to alter the way HTML features are exposed to users of assistive technologies,
          these modifications do not change the underlying parsing and allowed content models of HTML. For instance,
          a [^div^] allows an author to specify any role on it. However, this does not mean that the element can then be
          used in a way that deviates from the rules HTML has defined for the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, in the following example an author has specified a role of `link` on a `div` element. While
          HTML allows for a hyperlink (exposed as a `role=link`) to be a descendant of a `p` element, the HTML parser does not
          allow a `div` to be a descendant of a `p` element. 
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="Revised ARIA semantics with invalid HTML nesting">
          &lt;!-- Do not do this! -->
          &lt;p>
            ... &lt;div role=link tabindex=0>...&lt;/div> ... 
          &lt;/p>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The HTML parser will modify the above markup to be output as the following:
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="Unwanted rendered markup with valid alternative solution">
          &lt!-- The previous example's markup will render as follows -->
          &lt;p>...&lt;/p>
          &lt;div role=link tabindex=0>...&lt;/div> 
          ... 
          &lt;p>&lt;/p>
          
          &lt;!-- Use a span are allowed in p elements! -->
          &lt;p>
            ... &lt;span role=link tabindex=0>...&lt;/span> ...
          &lt;/p>
        </pre>
        <p>
          While this specification indicates the allowed ARIA attributes that can be specified on each HTML element,
          this example illustrates that even if a role is allowed, the context in which it is used can still result
          in potential rendering and accessibility issues.

        Document conformance requirements for use of ARIA attributes in HTML
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following table provides normative per-element document conformance requirements for the 
        use of ARIA markup in HTML documents. Additionally, it identifies the <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a> 
        that apply to [=HTML elements=]. The <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a> of these elements are defined 
        in [[html-aam-1.0|HTML AAM]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Each language feature (element) in a cell in the first column implies the ARIA semantics 
        (role, states, and properties) given in the cell in  the second column of the same row. 
        The third cell in each row defines the ARIA `role` values and `aria-*` attributes which authors MAY specify
        on the element. Where a cell in the third column includes the term <dfn><strong>Any</strong> `role`</dfn>
        it indicates that any `role` value <span class="addition correction">MAY be used on the element. However, 
        it is NOT RECOMMENDED for authors to specify the implicit role of the element, the `generic` role, or a role 
        <a href="#docconformance-deprecated">deprecated by ARIA</a> on these elements.</span> 
        If a cell in the third column includes the term <dfn><strong>No `role`</strong></dfn> it indicates 
        that authors MUST NOT overwrite the implicit ARIA semantics, or native semantics of the HTML element. 
      </p>

          These roles do not allow certain WAI-ARIA attributes to be specified by authors.
          HTML elements which expose these implicit WAI-ARIA roles also prohibit authors from
          specifying these WAI-ARIA attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elements which are identified as <dfn>Naming prohibited</dfn> are those which authors MUST NOT specify an 
          `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute, unless the element allows for its implicit role to be overwritten 
          by an explicit WAI-ARIA role which allows naming from authors. For more information see [[[#docconformance-naming]]].

        The elements marked with <dfn>No corresponding role</dfn>, in the second column of 
        the table do not have any <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a>, but they do have meaning 
        and this meaning may be represented in roles, states and properties not provided 
        by ARIA, and exposed to users of assistive technology via accessibility APIs. 
        It is therefore recommended that authors add a `role` attribute to a semantically 
        neutral element such as a [^div^] or [^span^], rather than overriding the semantics 
        of the listed elements.

          These features can be used to make accessibility tools render content
          to their users in more useful ways. For example, ASCII art, which is
          really an image, appears to be text, and in the absence of
          appropriate roles and properties would end up being rendered by
          screen readers as a nonsensical string of punctuation characters.
          Using the features described in this section, one can instead make
          the ATs skip the ASCII art and just read the caption:

        <!-- <section>
          <h4>Elements with implicit ARIA roles which prohibit naming</h4> -->
          <p>
            Authors MAY use <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2/#aria-label">`aria-label`</a> and <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2/#aria-labelledby">`aria-labelledby`</a> attributes to specify <a data-cite="accname-1.2/#dfn-accessible-name">accessible names</a> for elements which have an implicit or explicit ARIA role which allows naming from authors. [[[wai-aria-1.2]]] defines <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2/#namefromauthor">roles which allow naming from authors</a> as well as <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2/#namefromprohibited">roles where author naming is prohibited</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authors MUST NOT specify `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` on elements with implicit WAI-ARIA roles which cannot be named. HTML elements whose implicit WAI-ARIA roles prohibit naming from authors are identified in [[[#docconformance]]].
          </p>
          <p>
            The following markup example demonstrates a selection of HTML elements with implicit ARIA roles that prohibit naming from authors.
          </p>
          <pre class="HTML example" title="Elements with implicit ARIA roles which prohibit naming from authors">
            &lt;!-- DO NOT do the following! -->
            &lt;p aria-label="...">...&lt;/p>

            &lt;span aria-label="...">...&lt;span>

            &lt;code aria-label="...">...&lt;code>

            &lt;div aria-labelledby="...">...&lt;/div>
          </pre>
          <p>
            The following markup example demonstrates elements which have explicit WAI-ARIA roles which allow naming from authors. Due to the explicit roles specified on these elements, `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` attributes are allowed.
          </p>
          <pre class="HTML example" title="Elements with explicit ARIA roles which allow naming from authors">
            &lt;p role="link" tabindex="0" aria-label="...">...&lt;/p>

          Requirements for use of ARIA attributes in place of equivalent HTML attributes
        </h3>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated, authors MAY use `aria-*` attributes in place of their HTML equivalents on HTML elements where the `aria-*` semantics would 
          be expected. For example, authors MAY specify `aria-disabled=true` on a [^button^] element, while also implementing the necessary scripting to functionally 
          disable the `button`, rather than the use `disabled` attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          As stated in <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2#host_general_conflict">WAI-ARIA's Conflicts with Host Language Semantics</a>,
          when HTML elements use <em>both</em> `aria-*` attributes and their host language (HTML) equivalents, user agents MUST ignore the WAI-ARIA attributes – the 
          native HTML attributes with the same <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a> take precedence. For this reason, authors SHOULD NOT specify both the native HTML attribute 
          and the equivalent `aria-*` attribute on an element. Please review each attribute for any further author specific requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following table represents HTML elements and their attributes which have `aria-*` attribute parity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each language feature (element and attribute) in a cell in the first
          column implies the ARIA semantics (states, and properties) given in
          the cell in the second column of the same row. The third cell in each
          row defines how authors can use the native HTML feature, along with
          requirements for using the `aria-*` attributes that supply the same
          <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a>.

          Requirements for deprecated ARIA role, state and property and attributes
        </h2>
        <p>
          The ARIA Specification's <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2#deprecated">Deprecated Requirements</a> section indicates that if an ARIA feature is marked as deprecated then authors are advised not to use said feature for new content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following roles and attributes are deprecated features of ARIA and DPub ARIA. Conformance checkers MUST warn authors about the deprecated status of these features. Whenever possible, authors are advised to use alternatives to deprecated features.
        </p>

        <h3>Deprecated ARIA roles</h3>
        <ul>  
          <li><a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2#directory">`directory`</a></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          <p>The `directory` role is marked for deprecation in [[wai-aria-1.2|WAI-ARIA 1.2]]. In reality, the `directory` role had no functional difference to an element with an implicit or explicit `list` role. Authors are advised to use one of HTML's native list elements, or an ARIA `list` instead.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Deprecated DPub ARIA roles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a data-cite="dpub-aria-1.1#doc-biblioentry">`doc-biblioentry`</a></li>
          <li><a data-cite="dpub-aria-1.1#doc-endnote">`doc-endnote`</a></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note">
          <p>The `doc-biblioentry` and `doc-endnote` roles are marked for deprecation in [[[dpub-aria-1.1]]], as they are not valid children for an element with an implicit or explicit role of `list`. Authors can use standard list and child `li` elements without the need for these roles.</p>

          <p>The `aria-dropeffect` and `aria-grabbed` attributes were deprecated in [[wai-aria-1.1|WAI-ARIA 1.1]]. There is presently no feature in ARIA to replace their proposed functionality.</p>

      <p>
        Authors SHOULD use [=ASCII lowercase=] for all `role` token values
        and any state or property attributes (`aria-*`) whose values are
        <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2#propcharacteristic_value">defined as tokens</a>.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
        <p>
          While modern browsers treat the `role` or `aria-*` attribute values as [=ASCII case-insensitive=], not all assistive technologies will correctly parse these values.
        </p>
        <p>
          To reduce interoperability issues, authors are strongly encouraged to use [=ASCII lowercase=] for `aria-*` and `role` attribute values. Further, authors are encouraged to rigorously test with different browser and assistive technology combinations to ensure that their content will be correctly exposed to their users.

      <p>The following table maps (and extends) the <a data-cite=
        "html/dom.html#kinds-of-content">Kinds of content</a> and allowed descendant
        information (defined in the
        [[HTML]] specification) to elements that have an equivalent `role`.</p>
      <p>
        Column 1 links to the normative [[[wai-aria-1.2]]] definitions for each ARIA `role`.
        Column 2 identifies the <a data-cite="html/dom.html#kinds-of-content">Kinds of content</a>
        categories each `role` has when it is used on an HTML element.
        Column 3 indicates what kinds of HTML elements can be descendants of
        an element with an explicit `role` specified, often matching the HTML element with
        the same <a href="#implicit">implicit</a> role.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a [^button^] element has an implicit `role=button`.
        In HTML a `button` element allows [=phrasing content=] as descendants, and does not allow [=interactive content=]
        or descendants with a `tabindex` attribute.  Therefore, any elements specified with a `role=button` would follow
        the same descendant restrictions, and not allow any interactive content descendants,
        elements with a `tabindex` specified, or any elements with role values
        that are in the interactive content category (identified in column 3).
      </p>
      <div class="example" id="bad-descendants">
        <strong>Examples of non-conforming descendants</strong>

    <p>
      Additionally, there are certain roles which [[[wai-aria-1.2]]] has specified specific requirements for their allowed descendants. These have been identified in column 3 (Descendant allowances) by indicating to "Refer to the 'Required Owned Elements'" for those particular roles.

      <h2>Conformance checking requirements</h2>
      <p>Conformance checkers that claim support for checking ARIA in HTML documents
        MUST implement checks for the conformance requirements for use of the ARIA `role`
        and `aria-*` attributes on [=HTML elements=] as defined in this specification. </p>
      <p>
        A conforming document MUST NOT contain any elements with author defined `role`
        or `aria-*` attributes with values other than those which, per this specification,
        authors MAY use on each [=HTML element=] in [[[#docconformance]]].
        Conformance checkers SHOULD flag instances where authors are explicitly providing
        an element with a `role` which matches its
        <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.2#implicit_semantics">implicit ARIA semantics</a> as failures,
        as it is NOT RECOMMENDED for authors to explicitly set these roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        A conformance checker MAY define their own terminology, and level or levels of
        severity, when surfacing document failures to conform to this specification.

        Privacy and security considerations

      <p>
        This specification does not define the features of [[wai-aria-1.2]],
        [[dpub-aria-1.0]] or [[HTML]]. Rather it provides rules and guidance for conformance
        checkers that claim support for checking ARIA in HTML, as well as providing guidance to authors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, there are no known privacy or security impacts of this specification,
        as it defines no new features to introduce potential concern.
