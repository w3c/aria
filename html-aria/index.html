        This specification defines the authoring rules (author conformance requirements) for the use
        of [[[wai-aria-1.1]]] and [[[dpub-aria-1.0]]] attributes on [[HTML]] elements.
        This specification's primary objective is to define requirements for use
        with conformance checking tools used by authors (i.e., web developers). These requirements will aid authors
        in their development of web content, including custom interfaces/widgets, that makes use of ARIA to
        complement or extend the features of the host language [[HTML]].

      <p>
        ARIA in HTML is an [[HTML]] specification module. Any HTML features, conformance requirements, or terms that this specification
        module makes reference to, but does not explicitly define, are defined in the [[HTML|HTML specification]].

        Author requirements for use of ARIA in HTML
      </h2>
      <p>
        Authors MAY use the ARIA `role` and `aria-*` attributes to change
        the exposed meaning (<a data-cite="html/dom.html#semantics-2">semantics</a>) of
        [=HTML elements=], in accordance with the requirements described in
        [[wai-aria-1.1|WAI-ARIA]], except where these conflict with the
        <dfn data-cite="wai-aria-1.1#host_general_conflict">strong native semantics</dfn>
        or are equal to the
        <dfn data-cite="wai-aria-1.1#implicit_semantics">implicit ARIA semantics</dfn>
        of a given HTML element. The <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a> for
        HTML elements are defined in the
        [[html-aam-1.0|HTML Accessibility API Mappings]] specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        The constraints defined in this specification are intended to prevent
        authors from making assistive technology products report nonsensical
        user interface (UI) information that does not represent the actual UI
        of the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors MUST NOT use the ARIA `role` and `aria-*` attributes in
        a manner that conflicts with the semantics described in the
        [[[#docconformance]]] and [[[#docconformance-attr]]] tables.
        It is NOT RECOMMENDED for authors to set the ARIA `role` and
        `aria-*` attributes to values that match the
        <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a> defined in the table. Doing so is
        unnecessary and can potentially lead to unintended consequences.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>ARIA semantics that extend and diverge from HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Through the use of ARIA, authors can express semantics that go beyond the current native
        HTML capabilities. This can be very useful, as it provides authors the opportunity to 
        create widgets, or extend HTML features beyond what they'd be able to do with HTML alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, a `button` element has no native HTML feature to indicate a "pressed" state.
        ARIA allows authors to extend the semantics of the element by use of the `aria-pressed`
        attribute, allowing for an aural UI that will match the visual presentation of the control.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following example, a `button` allows for a user to toggle the state of a 
        setting within a web application. Native HTML does not presently have a way to 
        communicate a `button` being in a "pressed" or "unpressed" state, so ARIA can
        be used to extend the `button` element's semantics.
      </p>
      <pre class="HTML example" title="Communicate a button's pressed state with ARIA">
      &lt;button aria-pressed=true>...&lt;/button>
      </pre>
      <p>
        But then there are also situations where certain `aria-*` attributes are
        allowed for use on elements with particular `role`s, while the equivalent native attribute
        is currently not valid in HTML itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, HTML has no direct concept of a disabled hyperlink (`a href` element). 
        Constructs such as `&lt;a href="..." disabled&gt; ... &lt;/a&gt;` are not valid, 
        and will not be conveyed to assistive technologies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        ARIA, however, diverges from HTML in this regard and does allow for an `aria-disabled`
        attribute to be specified on an element with an explicit `role=link`. If an author were
        to specify an `aria-disabled=true` on an HTML hyperlink, user agents would not functionally
        treat the hyperlink any differently (it would still be clickable/operable), however it 
        would be exposed to assistive technologies as being in the disabled state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, while native HTML `option` elements that are descendants of a `select` can 
        only be set as being `selected`, elements with an explicit `option` role can not only 
        allow the equivalent `aria-selected`, but also the `aria-checked` attribute, supporting
        widgets/constructs that go beyond the capabilities of a native `select`.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, in these situations where ARIA and HTML have feature parity, but diverge 
        in allowances, it can create for a misalignment in support, if not also user experiences. 
        In the situations where ARIA allows a feature which HTML does not support, it will often
        be in the author's, and ultimately the user's best interest to instead implement as a 
        fully custom ARIA implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following example, a hyperlink needs to be communicated as being in the disabled
        state. HTML does not allow for the use of the `disabled` attribute on a hyperlink,
        and using `aria-disabled=true` would communicate the hyperlink as being disabled to 
        assistive technologies, but would not actually disable the element. The most effective way 
        to both communicate and actually disable a hyperlink would be to remove the `href` from 
        the `a` element, thus creating a placeholder link. Then, use ARIA can be applied to this
        placeholder link to communicate the element's intended role and state.
      </p>

      &lt;a role=link aria-disabled=true>...&lt;/a>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Don't override default roles
        </h3>
        <p>
          The following uses a `role=heading` on a [^button^] element. This is
          not allowed, because the `button` element has default characteristics
          that conflict with the heading role.
        </p>
        <pre class="example HTML" title="Wrong role">
          &lt;button role="heading"&gt;search&lt;/button&gt;
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Don't add redundant roles
        </h3>
        <p>
          The following uses a `role=button` on a [^button^] element. This is
          unnecessary, as "button" is already exposed as the implicit role for
          the element. In practice this redundancy will likely not have any
          unforeseen side effects, other than unnecessarily making the markup
          more verbose, and incorrectly signaling to other authors that this
          practice is useful.
        </p>
        <pre class="example HTML" title="Redundant role on button">
          &lt;!-- Avoid doing this! -->
          &lt;button role="button"&gt;...&lt;/button&gt;
        </pre>
        <p>
          Similarly, the following uses a `role=group` on a [^fieldset^] element, and a `role=Main` on a [^main^] element.
          This is unnecessary, because the `fieldset` element is implicitly
          exposed as a `role=group`, as is the `main` element implicitly exposed as a `role=main`. Again, in practice this will likely not
          have any unforeseen side effects to users of assistive technology, as long as the declaration of the `role` value uses [=ASCII lowercase=]. Please see [[[#case-sensitivity]]] for more information.
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="Redundant role on fieldset and main">
          &lt;!-- Avoid doing this! -->
          &lt;fieldset role="group"&gt;...&lt;/fieldset&gt;
          &lt;!-- or this! -->
          &lt;main role="Main">...&lt;/main>
        </pre>
        <p>
          The following uses a `role=list` on an [^ul^] element. This is
          generally unnecessary, because the `ul` element is implicitly exposed
          as a `role=list`. However, some user agents suppress a list's
          implicit ARIA semantics if list markers are removed. Authors can
          use `role=list` to reinstate the role if necessary, though this
          practice would generally not be recommended, otherwise.
        </p>
        <pre class="HTML example" title="Redundant role on list">
          &lt;!-- Generally avoid doing this! -->
          &lt;ul role="list"&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt;

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>
          Be cautious of side effects
        </h3>
        <p>
          The following uses a `role=button` on a [^summary^] element. This is
          unnecessary and can result in cross-platform issues. For instance,
          preventing the element from correctly exposing its state, and forcing
          the role of `button`, when it might otherwise be exposed with a
          different role.

        The elements marked with <dfn>No corresponding role</dfn>, in the second column of

        and this meaning may be represented in roles, states and properties not provided 
        by ARIA, and exposed to users of assistive technology via accessibility APIs. 
        It is therefore recommended that authors add a `role` attribute to a semantically 
        neutral element such as a [^div^] or [^span^], rather than overriding the semantics 
        of the listed elements.

          screen readers as a nonsensical string of punctuation characters.

          Requirements for use of ARIA attributes in place of equivalent HTML attributes
        </h3>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise stated, authors MAY use `aria-*` attributes in place of their HTML equivalents on HTML elements where the `aria-*` semantics would be expected. For example, authors MAY specify `aria-disabled=true` on a [^button^] element, while also implementing the necessary scripting to functionally disable the `button`, rather than the use `disabled` attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          As stated in
          <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.1#host_general_conflict">WAI-ARIA's Conflicts with Host Language Semantics</a>,
          when HTML elements use <em>both</em> `aria-*` attributes and their host language (HTML) equivalents, user agents MUST ignore the WAI-ARIA attributes – the native HTML attributes with the same <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a> take precedence. For this reason, authors SHOULD NOT specify both the native HTML attribute and the equivalent `aria-*` attribute on an element. Please review each attribute for any further author specific requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following table represents HTML elements and their attributes which have `aria-*` attribute parity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each language feature (element and attribute) in a cell in the first
          column implies the ARIA semantics (states, and properties) given in
          the cell in the second column of the same row. The third cell in each
          row defines how authors can use the native HTML feature, along with
          requirements for using the `aria-*` attributes that supply the same
          <a>implicit ARIA semantics</a>.

        Authors SHOULD use [=ASCII lowercase=] for all `role` token values

        <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.1#propcharacteristic_value">defined as tokens</a>.

        <p>
          While modern browsers treat the `role` or `aria-*` attribute values as [=ASCII case-insensitive=], not all assistive technologies will correctly parse these values.
        </p>
        <p>
          To reduce interoperability issues, authors are strongly encouraged to use [=ASCII lowercase=] for `aria-*` and `role` attribute values. Further, authors are encouraged to rigorously test with different browser and assistive technology combinations to ensure that their content will be correctly exposed to their users.

      <p>The following table maps (and extends) the <a data-cite=
        "html/dom.html#kinds-of-content">Kinds of content</a> and allowed descendant
        information (defined in the
        [[HTML]] specification) to elements that have an equivalent `role`.</p>
      <p>
        Column 1 links to the normative [[[wai-aria-1.1]]] definitions for each ARIA `role`.
        Column 2 identifies the <a data-cite="html/dom.html#kinds-of-content">Kinds of content</a>
        categories each `role` has when it is used on an HTML element.
        Column 3 indicates what kinds of HTML elements can be descendants of
        an element with an explicit `role` specified, often matching the HTML element with
        the same <a href="#implicit">implicit</a> role.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a [^button^] element has an implicit `role=button`.
        In HTML a `button` element allows [=phrasing content=] as descendants, and does not allow [=interactive content=]
        or descendants with a `tabindex` attribute.  Therefore, any elements specified with a `role=button` would follow
        the same descendant restrictions, and not allow any interactive content descendants,
        elements with a `tabindex` specified, or any elements with role values
        that are in the interactive content category (identified in column 3).
      </p>
      <div class="example" id="bad-descendants">
        <strong>Examples of non-conforming descendants</strong>

    <p>
      Additionally, there are certain roles which [[[wai-aria-1.1]]] has specified specific requirements for their allowed descendants. These have been identified in column 3 (Descendant allowances) by indicating to "Refer to the 'Required Owned Elements'" for those particular roles.

      <h2>Conformance checking requirements</h2>
      <p>Conformance checkers that claim support for checking ARIA in HTML documents
        MUST implement checks for the conformance requirements for use of the ARIA `role`
        and `aria-*` attributes on [=HTML elements=] as defined in this specification. </p>
      <p>
        A conforming document MUST NOT contain any elements with author defined `role`
        or `aria-*` attributes with values other than those which, per this specification,
        authors MAY use on each [=HTML element=] in [[[#docconformance]]].
        Conformance checkers SHOULD flag instances where authors are explicitly providing
        an element with a `role` which matches its
        <a data-cite="wai-aria-1.1#implicit_semantics">implicit ARIA semantics</a> as failures,
        as it is NOT RECOMMENDED for authors to explicitly set these roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        A conformance checker MAY define their own terminology, and level or levels of
        severity, when surfacing document failures to conform to this specification.

        Privacy and security considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification does not define the features of [[wai-aria-1.1]],
        [[dpub-aria-1.0]] or [[HTML]]. Rather it provides rules and guidance for conformance
        checkers that claim support for checking ARIA in HTML, as well as providing guidance to authors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, there are no known privacy or security impacts of this specification,
        as it defines no new features to introduce potential concern.
