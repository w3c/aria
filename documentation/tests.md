## ARIA "author MUST" / Validator Tests

Validator tests are written for "author MUST" or "author MUST NOT" statements. An "author MUST" statement is testable if an HTML validator (such as [AXE](https://www.deque.com/axe/) or [validator.nu](https://validator.nu/) can test whether a given piece of HTML conforms to the specification. Not all "author must" statements are testable. For example, the following statement is testable:

> In order for elements with a role of img to be perceivable, authors MUST provide a label using the aria-label or aria-labelledby attribute.

But the following statement is not testable, because managing focus is dynamic and cannot be done by an html validator:

> Authors MUST manage focus on the following container roles...

The validator tests belong in the [validator-test directory](https://github.com/w3c/aria/tree/main/validator-tests). When adding or updating a test, also supply the test results required in the [README](https://github.com/w3c/aria/tree/main/validator-tests/README.md).

## ARIA "user agent MUST"

Ideally, we should have a test suite to test all "user agent MUST" statements, but we do not have yet have all the TestDriver interfaces required to write many of these tests. WPT TestDriver (through WebDriver) gives us access to `computedrole` and `comutedlabel`, so we are now adding various role tests (ARIA, HTML-AAM, etc.) and name computation tests (AccName). The IDL interface is also testable in WPT.

If a change adds or changes a "user agent must" or "user agent must not" statement, please add a issue describing the test once the PR is ready for merge. 

## ARIA IDL Interface Tests

Automated tests for the [ARIA IDL interface](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#idl-interface) are in WPT. We have two test files:
* [aria-attribute-reflection.html](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/dom/aria-attribute-reflection.html), [Results on wpt.fyi](https://wpt.fyi/results/html/dom/aria-element-reflection.html?label=experimental&label=master&aligned&view=subtest)
* [aria-element-reflection.html](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/master/html/dom/aria-element-reflection.html), [Results on wpt.fyi](https://wpt.fyi/results/html/dom/aria-attribute-reflection.html?label=experimental&label=master&aligned&view=subtest)

When the IDL Interface section is updated, these tests should be update accordingly.

## WAI-ARIA Automated Tests

- [Results of ARIA tests in WPT](https://wpt.fyi/results/wai-aria?label=master&label=experimental&aligned)
- [Source of ARIA tests in WPT](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/wai-aria)
- [Additional Issues for new automated tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2023-accessibility-testing/issues).
- **Manual Tests:** Some additional platform-specific tests mapping tests are located in [WPT's core-aam folder](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/tree/master/core-aam). They are "manual" tests in that you have to use a tool outside of the web browser and WPT test suite to inspect the accessibility API. For now, Valerie will maintain these CORE-AAM tests and no one else needs to write them.

## HTML-AAM Automated Tests

## Interop 2023 Accessibility Investigation 

Many of the automated tests in listed above started as a [Accessibility Investigation](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2023-accessibility-testing) for Web Platform Tests Interop 2023. Revew the [Issues List](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2023-accessibility-testing/issues) and [Scoring Criteria](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop-2023-accessibility-testing/issues/3) for more detail.
